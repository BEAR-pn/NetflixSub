00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:54.291
We make ourselves a problem for Piltover, and they will send the enforcers.

00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:56.458
So? Why answer to them?

00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:59.041
These are our streets. Someone should remind them of that.

00:25:59.125 --> 00:26:01.458
You're not hearing me. That path?

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.458
This?

00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:05.583
It's not gonna solve your problems.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.666
Just makes more of them.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.458
We clear?

00:26:11.666 --> 00:26:12.666
[spits]

00:26:14.291 --> 00:26:15.708
-[Vander exhales] -[groans]

00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:18.333
-How'd you get this? -[scoffs]

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.458
Some idiot was following us.

00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:23.208
On our side? Who?

00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:26.541
I don't know. He was after the stuff.

00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:27.750
Where is it now?

00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:31.333
[sighs] We lost it.

00:26:32.625 --> 00:26:33.500
All of it?

00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:35.750
Good.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.541
Nothing can tie you to what happened up there.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.083
You're gonna have to lay low for a bit, understand?

00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:45.000
Okay.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.041
We're gonna be fine, right?

00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:49.791
I'll take care of it.

00:26:57.333 --> 00:27:01.375
Oh, you did put that idiot on his ass, though, right?

00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:02.958
Mm.

00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:05.291
[chuckles]

00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:09.375
[footsteps approaching]

00:27:10.916 --> 00:27:12.250
[Mylo hums]

00:27:13.375 --> 00:27:15.541
Get up, Claggor. We're going out.

00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:17.625
Wait, now? [huffs]

00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:20.208
Hey, hey, that's mine!

00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:22.833
-You wanna be treated like adults, right? -[Claggor grunts]

00:27:23.416 --> 00:27:26.500
Then you should know better than to come back from a job empty-handed.

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:29.875
[Vander] I'm gonna have a little word with your informant.

00:27:31.791 --> 00:27:35.583
All right, give me the details of exactly what happened up there.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.500
[grunts]

00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:49.791
[suspenseful music]

00:27:54.708 --> 00:27:55.666
[Mylo] She's a problem.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.041
[Vi sighs] Mylo, I'm really not…

00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:58.916
[Mylo] Do you remember what was in that bag?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.875
The biggest payout we've ever seen and she just lost it.

00:28:01.958 --> 00:28:03.458
She made a mistake.

00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.375
Name one time she hasn't.

00:28:05.458 --> 00:28:07.833
-[Vi] She's young. -[Mylo] Don't bullshit me.

00:28:07.916 --> 00:28:09.833
You were twice the person at half her age.

00:28:10.958 --> 00:28:13.125
You know what, Mylo? You're right.

00:28:13.708 --> 00:28:15.791
There's a bunch of things Powder just can't do.

00:28:15.875 --> 00:28:17.875
-[Mylo] You don't have to tell me twice. -[bangs]

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.250
-Like, complain about everything. -What?

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:25.166
-And brag nonstop. -Okay, okay, I see where this is going.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.791
[Vi] Pick fights with the group when we need to focus.

00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:28.708
[chuckling] Vi, I…

00:28:28.791 --> 00:28:31.708
And tell strangers on the street that we got a nice haul?

00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:34.416
-I, I didn't mean to-- -Powder's my problem, okay?

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.250
Your problem is never knowing when to shut up.

00:28:36.333 --> 00:28:38.541
But I'm gonna help you with that. Ready?

00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:40.083
You see this look on my face?

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:42.750
This will always mean it's time to shut up.

00:28:42.833 --> 00:28:44.416
But… I…

00:28:45.125 --> 00:28:46.000
[groans]

00:28:46.083 --> 00:28:49.000
[background chatter]

00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:55.000
Nobody comes in.

00:28:57.416 --> 00:28:58.333
We're closed.

00:28:58.833 --> 00:29:00.083
Well, open up.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.458
For good. You can take your worthless junk elsewhere.

00:29:04.541 --> 00:29:06.291
[groans] Just as well.

00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:08.916
Owner's the shittiest businessman I know.

00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:13.000
[both laugh]

00:29:13.083 --> 00:29:15.125
-Ekko. What's going on with that thing? -[grunts]

00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:17.916
Give me a few seconds. The cannon pinion's still busted.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.416
Finish it later. Vander and I need a word.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.291
-But-- -[Benzo] Uh-uh. Off you go.

00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:23.708
[metal clanks]

00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:24.916
[Ekko grunts]

00:29:28.083 --> 00:29:30.041
-[Ekko] Claggor. -[Claggor] He-he-hey, Little Man.

00:29:30.583 --> 00:29:31.666
You're a little early.

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:34.875
My guys are still roundin' up this month's collections.

00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:37.250
Won't have numbers until next, um…

00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:38.916
[Benzo] Whoo.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.083
Why are you muckin' about with this?

00:29:42.166 --> 00:29:44.041
I assume you've heard.

00:29:44.125 --> 00:29:46.041
Yeah, me and half the undercity.

00:29:46.125 --> 00:29:49.833
[sighs] How could they be so stupid?

00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:52.375
The younger folk think it's the right thing to do.

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:54.291
[Vander] Yeah, and Vi's one of them.

00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:57.250
Throws herself at trouble wherever she can find some.

00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:59.333
Eh, they're growing up, Vander.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.708
Looking to write their own stories. You can't protect them forever.

00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:04.833
[sighs]

00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:06.500
Someone was following them.

00:30:06.583 --> 00:30:10.041
-Whole lot of someones, from what I heard. -Not enforcers.

00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:12.750
-Someone on our side. -Who?

00:30:14.666 --> 00:30:17.250
There's worse things than enforcers out there.

00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:19.833
We both know that.

00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:23.458
Yeah, I was hopin' you'd be working today.

00:30:23.541 --> 00:30:25.333
-Did you guys go? -Sure did.

00:30:25.416 --> 00:30:28.125
Hey, listen, how did you find that place?

00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:30.708
-I just-- -Whoa, did you fight the enforcers?

00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:32.583
What? Oh, no. Eh, just some bums.

00:30:32.666 --> 00:30:34.625
Oh, did Vi kick their asses?

00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:36.666
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be here otherwise.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.708
Oh, she showed me a couple moves to practice. Look.

00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:42.333
[Ekko grunting]

00:30:42.416 --> 00:30:44.458
-Yeah, it's… it's coming along. -Ya!

00:30:44.541 --> 00:30:46.541
Hey, so, how'd you find that place, anyway?

00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:48.833
Uh, this weirdo came into the shop.

00:30:48.916 --> 00:30:51.791
Bought a whole bunch of stuff Benzo only keeps there for display.

00:30:51.875 --> 00:30:54.125
He paid in gold and didn't even haggle.

00:30:54.208 --> 00:30:57.000
I charged him double price. Sucker.

00:30:57.083 --> 00:31:00.500
-But how did you know where he lived? -Uh, followed him.

00:31:00.583 --> 00:31:02.666
-How else? -Oh. Right.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:04.916
[Claggor] Oh, crap.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.291
[breathing]

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.125
-Uh… -They'll be fine. Go.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Well, hello.

00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:19.333
[breathing]

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.208
[door opens]

00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:25.375
[wind gusts]

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.500
-[Benzo] Evening, friends. -[hissing]

00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:31.833
[whispers] Shit.

00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:36.166
[sighs]

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.791
Something I can help you with?

00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:41.500
Some trencher trash attacked one of the buildings in the Academy district,

00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:43.083
but you already knew that.

00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:45.125
We're looking for the culprits.

00:31:45.208 --> 00:31:46.208
Got a description?

00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:50.166
Yeah, it's exactly who you're picturing in that thick head of yours.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:52.416
Mm. You think my head is thick?

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.583
Uh, just past the average.

00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:55.958
Listen, you shady son of a…

00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:58.791
[enforcer] How about you go for a little walk, Marcus?

00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:00.375
Cool off a bit.

00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:02.541
Go.

00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:05.083
[slurps]

00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:12.041
[exhales]

00:32:16.041 --> 00:32:19.166
[foreboding music]

00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:21.458
[creaks]

00:32:21.541 --> 00:32:23.250
[rat squeaks]

00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:32.708
[Benzo] Lovely chap you've brought.

00:32:33.416 --> 00:32:35.916
[indistinct chatter]

00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:39.583
[enforcer] Don't mind the kid.

00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:41.666
Doesn't know when to pipe down.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.250
[Vander] Some things are the same topside and bottom.

00:32:49.208 --> 00:32:51.125
You know this crossed a line upstairs.

00:32:51.208 --> 00:32:52.416
Was anyone hurt?

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.416
A building was blown to bits. What do you think?

00:32:56.166 --> 00:32:57.416
[sighs]

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.541
Those who did this will be dealt with.

00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:03.291
That workshop belonged to the Kirammans.

00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:06.125
You know what kind of stuff they had in there?

00:33:06.791 --> 00:33:09.250
Makes this place look like a candy shop.

00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:12.750
The Council needs someone to make an example of.

00:33:12.833 --> 00:33:14.583
People need to feel safe.

00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:16.416
Yeah, topside people.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.291
[enforcer] We had a deal, Vander.

00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:22.375
You keep your people off my streets, and I stay out of your business.

00:33:24.416 --> 00:33:26.875
Give me a name. We'll do things quiet.

00:33:26.958 --> 00:33:28.958
No one will know you were involved.

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:30.500
I can't do that.

00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:33.791
You don't seem to grasp how serious this is.

00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:36.250
If I don't put someone behind bars tonight,

00:33:36.333 --> 00:33:40.375
the next time I come down here, I'll have an army of enforcers with me.

00:33:40.458 --> 00:33:42.583
We both know how that'll go.

00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:46.583
I'm sorry, Grayson, but I can't offer up my own people.

00:33:50.916 --> 00:33:51.833
[exhales]

00:33:52.375 --> 00:33:55.208
If you change your mind, this will reach me.

00:33:56.708 --> 00:33:57.833
[Grayson] And only me.

00:33:57.916 --> 00:33:59.833
[footsteps receding]

00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:04.583
[door opens]

00:34:05.083 --> 00:34:06.333
[exhales]

00:34:06.416 --> 00:34:07.791
[door closes]

00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:10.541
[rock music plays]

00:34:13.333 --> 00:34:15.791
[rock music playing continues]

00:34:24.208 --> 00:34:25.625
What are you calling this one?

00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:29.500
[Powder] Whisker.

00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:34.666
-You wanna talk about today? -What's the point?

00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:37.958
I ruined everything. I always do.

00:34:38.041 --> 00:34:39.333
Nobody said that.

00:34:39.416 --> 00:34:43.416
No. Just that you were "twice the person" at half my age.

00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:46.083
You heard them.

00:34:46.166 --> 00:34:48.083
I'm not a fighter.

00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.500
You don't have to be.

00:34:51.083 --> 00:34:54.916
Look, I've got these and you've got those.

00:34:55.416 --> 00:34:56.583
They never work.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.416
They will.

00:34:59.833 --> 00:35:01.416
-Come with me. -What?

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:03.208
[Vi] Come on.

00:35:07.583 --> 00:35:10.625
[background chatter]

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:19.625
What are we doing here?

00:35:20.958 --> 00:35:22.833
See that gutter running along the canal?

00:35:31.083 --> 00:35:34.041
[Vi] That's where Claggor got his foot stuck running from enforcers.

00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:38.125
They thought it was funny, so they left him there.

00:35:39.333 --> 00:35:41.125
He was out all night before we found him.

00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:44.541
That sign?

00:35:47.625 --> 00:35:49.208
-[Vi] You see it? -[Powder] Uh-huh.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.666
Mylo tripped over his own paint bucket

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.458
and nearly fell off trying to draw a giant middle finger.

00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:58.166
-[Vi] His ass made that splotch. -[Powder laughs]

00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:01.333
And that?

00:36:03.041 --> 00:36:03.875
[Vi sighs]

00:36:03.958 --> 00:36:07.875
When I was a kid, some guy took my favorite toy and threw it up there.

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:11.458
I used to come out here at night and stare at it,

00:36:12.791 --> 00:36:17.375
hoping maybe the wind or a bird might knock it down.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.625
We've all had bad days.

00:36:23.708 --> 00:36:27.083
But we learn. And we stick together.

00:36:30.666 --> 00:36:32.291
Oh, I forgot.

00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:34.541
These were in my pocket.

00:36:35.375 --> 00:36:37.958
-They're from the apartment. -What are they?

00:36:39.958 --> 00:36:40.958
I don't know.

00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:44.083
-Should we show Vander? -No.

00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:48.250
[exhales]

00:36:48.875 --> 00:36:50.833
Let's keep this our little secret.

00:36:52.125 --> 00:36:56.000
Mylo's wrong, Powder. You're stronger than you think.

00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:58.333
And one day…

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.541
this city's gonna respect us.

00:37:02.208 --> 00:37:05.166

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.041
[grumbles]

00:37:35.708 --> 00:37:38.666
[man 1] You were supposed to follow them and not interfere.

00:37:39.208 --> 00:37:41.708
[grunting] I'm sorry.

00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:44.208
[Deckard] They just caught us by surprise.

00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:48.416
[man 1] Now his accomplice is asking questions about you.

00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:52.208
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:53.541
[grunts]

00:37:54.791 --> 00:37:59.833
The kids. It was their fault, the explosion in the upper city.

00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:01.708
[man 1] That was them?

00:38:01.791 --> 00:38:05.416
[Deckard] Yeah. The topsiders are up in arms looking for 'em.

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:08.625
[man 1] Vander's in trouble.

00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:12.583
[nervous chuckle]

00:38:14.166 --> 00:38:16.750
[man 1] Smartest thing you ever said, boy.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.625
Get him a meal.

00:38:18.708 --> 00:38:20.375
[breathes sharply]

00:38:20.458 --> 00:38:22.291
But keep him off the streets.

00:38:26.083 --> 00:38:27.958
Our timeline has moved up.

00:38:28.666 --> 00:38:30.291
It's almost ready.

00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:32.541
[cat meows]

00:38:32.625 --> 00:38:33.666
[man 1] Show me.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.541

00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:41.750

00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:43.041
Feeding time.

00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:50.125
And the side effects?

00:38:51.666 --> 00:38:53.541
[man 2] Stabilizing.

You have a subject in mind?

00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:39.083
[man 1] Someone just volunteered.
