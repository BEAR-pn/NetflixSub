WEBVTT

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.830
Things were busy that summer.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.160
The frequent disasters of the past year probably played a role,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.310
but cursed spirits were springing up like maggots.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.780
Exorcise, absorb.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.340
Over and over.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.060
Exorcise.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.600
Absorb.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.220
No one else understands

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.520
what cursed spirits taste like.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.760
It's like swallowing a dirty rag that's been used to clean up shit and vomit.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.600
Exorcise.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.570
Absorb.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.950
"What I witnessed isn't uncommon."

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.890
"I understood the ugliness of the masses,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.300
and still chose to be a jujutsu sorcerer who saves others."

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.040
That's what I've been telling myself ever since that day.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.310
Ever since that day.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.120
Apparently, this used to be the home of the president

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.720
of a company managing a local chain of barbecue restaurants.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.220
However, in July of last year,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.880
the mad cow disease breakout dealt a fatal blow to his restaurants,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.400
so he committed suicide with his family after they were buried under vast debt.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.360
From then on, local rumors claimed the president's home was haunted,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.370
so local school kids, college students from outside the prefecture,

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.960
job-hoppers, and others would visit it as part of a test of courage,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.830
and subsequently go missing.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.460
Those rumors brought about more rumors,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.550
and the damage just continued to spread.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.880
Rumors do tend to spread rather quickly around haunted spots.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.380
They can spread at an unbelievable pace nowadays, thanks to the Internet.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.150
This all just means even more work for us jujutsu sorcerers.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.910
In addition to that, three grade school kids went missing on their way home from school.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.400
There's also a high chance the families, police, colleagues,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.160
and friends who trace the paths of those who disappeared

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.520
will reach the mansion and become victims themselves.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.410
We have to sever the root of this issue as soon as possible.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.750
HQ sent us to investigate because they reached the same conclusion.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.990
Warning! Entering These Premises Is Forbidden! Many Have Gone Missing!
HQ sent us to investigate because they reached the same conclusion.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.710
Warning! Entering These Premises Is Forbidden! Many Have Gone Missing!

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.750
They're even paying my fees, which aren't cheap.
Warning! Entering These Premises Is Forbidden! Many Have Gone Missing!

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.370
They're even paying my fees, which aren't cheap.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.390
Did you overcharge them again?

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.860
You make it sound so bad.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.160
Call it negotiation.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.040
We're here.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.840
Let's go, then.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.230
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.600
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.790
Purify that—

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.320
There's no need for a veil.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.240
Huh?

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.700
I don't sense the presence of any Curses.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.530
The cause is almost certainly inside the building.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.280
You can cast the veil later if we end up attacking it from outside.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.000
...True.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.210
It's unlocked.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.400
Seems like something's blocking the door.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.170
What is all this?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.710
Mei-san.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.800
It's here.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.350
And it's all around us, too.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.110
Let's get going.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.950
I don't need that, but you do, right?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.270
Thank you.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.450
All right.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.960
I-Incredible.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.710
Oh, it still has electricity.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.260
For now, let's have a look inside the building.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.070
I'll take this floor,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.740
you take the second.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.270
Huh? All by myself?

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.970
Is there a problem with that?

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.600
N-No, i-it's fine.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.350
Off you go, then.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.800
Okay.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.040
This is the last one.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.560
You could be the next big Scream Queen.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.640
Jeez!

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.040
Please don't startle me like that!

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.140
You got startled all on your own.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.810
Are you done exploring the first floor?

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.520
This is the first floor.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.530
Huh?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.320
I was walking down the first floor hallway.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.720
What? But...

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.440
I know I entered a room at the end of the hallway...

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.490
A box of candy.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.630
A bag of potato chips.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.670
Cans.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.510
A backpack.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.170
A sweatshirt.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.980
I've already seen this three times.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.960
And see these marks? I made them on my way through here.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.200
It would seem that we're already in the belly of the beast.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.430
Huh?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.560
For real?

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.660
How long is this hallway?

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.820
We've been moving for thirty minutes,

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.080
so about four kilometers so far.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.040
It's not an innate domain, is it?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.820
It's not.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.180
Those are manifestations of the spirit's mindscape.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.120
Which means...

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.880
This is a barrier.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.470
Correct.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.110
Most likely, the victims were trapped inside this

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.210
and then killed by the cursed spirit.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.560
Though, considering the use of this technique,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.150
the cursed spirit itself should be weak.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.060
So if we can just escape this barrier...

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.740
Now, quiz time.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.110
How would you break this, Utahime?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.880
This hallway is repeating itself.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.720
At first...

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.770
I thought...

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.080
I'm surprised you could touch them.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.940
...it was shaped like a donut.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.040
But we passed by four of the marks you made, right?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.690
When I calculated how many paces apart they were, I got...

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.300
122,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.440
203,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.760
157,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.690
and 270 paces.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.040
So the spacing between marks was random.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.660
I see.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.210
The interval between repetitions isn't standardized.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.720
Which means that, most likely...

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.800
this barrier is patching spaces together.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:23.380
So if we both run down the hallway at top speed, then at some point...

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.480
It'll break.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.390
Close. Ninety points.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.400
D'oh.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.640
What's the remaining ten?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.530
When we run, we do so in opposite directions at the same time.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.070
I get it!

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.130
So my patching theory was correct,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.900
and if we quickly advance in different directions,

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.190
that makes it harder for the cursed spirit to hold the barrier together.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.190
And once we have that opening, we might be able to get out.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.340
One hundred points.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.840
Then, with that settled...

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.680
If this works, I'll be expecting a promotion.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.550
How much do you have in savings?

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.370
What?

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.720
Never mind. I'll think about it.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.780
Right!

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.140
Okay... Ready, set...

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.160
Go!

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.690
We did it!

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.950
Wait, wha—

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.340
I'm here to save you,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.060
Utahime.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.320
JUJUTSU KAISEN Hidden Inventory/Premature Death

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.300
Jujutsu High Second-Year Gojo Satoru
Are you crying?

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.240
Second-grade Sorcerer Iori Utahime
I'm not crying!

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.470
And be more polite!
Second-grade Sorcerer Iori Utahime

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.510
If I was crying, would you console me?
Second-grade Sorcerer Iori Utahime

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.260
First-grade Sorcerer Mei Mei
I'd certainly appreciate that.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.870
Nah, you wouldn't cry, Mei-san.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.030
You're strong.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.350
That so?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.020
Gojo! You listen here!

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.440
I don't need your hel—

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.330
Don't swallow it.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.350
I'll absorb it later.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.950
Satoru, it's not nice to pick on the weak.
Jujutsu High Second-Year Geto Suguru

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.190
What kind of idiot picks on the strong?

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.560
You're the one fanning the flames like it comes naturally, Geto-kun.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.030
Utahime-senpai!

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.340
Are you okay?

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.590
Jujutsu High Second-Year Ieiri Shoko
Shoko!

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.710
I was worried about you.
Jujutsu High Second-Year Ieiri Shoko

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.720
We hadn't heard from you for two whole days.
Jujutsu High Second-Year Ieiri Shoko

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.720
Shoko!

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:18.650
Shoko! Don't let yourself turn out like those two!

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.230
I won't turn into trash like them.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.640
Said Trash
I won't turn into trash like them.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.710
The path Utahime walked is falling apart.
Said Trash

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.210
Shut up.
Said Trash

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.530
Said Trash

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.230
Wait, two days?

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.320
Ah, was the cursed spirit's barrier one of those that messes with time?

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.540
They're rare, but they do happen now and then.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.430
I thought it was odd, since Mei-san was with you.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.510
Seems like it was.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.640
Something the matter?

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.050
No. Just realized that means it was actually two days' labor,

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.730
and that means extra fees paid out to me.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.140
She's planning to overcharge again.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.270
That aside, what about the veil, you three?

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.650
White News
Degradation of gas pipes causes explosion
Next, the explosion that occurred yesterday in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.580
One of you three said they would cast the veil themselves
The explosion was caused by degradation of gas pipes.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.240
Our reporter on the scene...
One of you three said they would cast the veil themselves
The explosion was caused by degradation of gas pipes.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.150
and left your assistant supervisor behind, didn't you?
Our reporter on the scene...

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.570
and left your assistant supervisor behind, didn't you?

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.110
And then you forgot the veil.
First-grade Sorcerer Yaga Masamichi

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.460
Come forward.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.960
Sensei!

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.820
Why don't we stop this hunt for the culprit?!

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.000
So it was you, Satoru.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.800
Discipline

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:29.040
Is a veil that necessary in the first place?

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.680
It's not like it matters if normies see or not, right?

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.430
They can't see cursed spirits or cursed techniques, anyway.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.110
Of course it's not good for them to see.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.220
The strongest deterrent against the outbreak

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.410
of a cursed spirit is the mental calm of the populace.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.210
That's exactly why we have to conceal

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.900
the threats they can't even see as much as possible.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And that's not all—

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.160
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.630
Looking out for the weak is so exhausting, honestly.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.890
Survival of the weakest.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.460
That's how a society should be.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.560
The weak help each other and discourage any who are too strong.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.130
Listen, Satoru.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.710
Jujutsu exists to protect non-jujutsu sorcerers.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.510
Is that your moral argument?

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.730
I hate moral arguments.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.100
What?

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.820
Assigning reasons and responsibility to strength

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.530
is what those who are weak do.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.270
Quit making yourself feel better by spouting bullshit.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.390
Blegh.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.200
Run for it.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.470
Want to take this outside, Satoru?

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.500
You feeling lonely?

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:55.510
Go by yourself.
You feeling lonely?

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.880
Go by yourself.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.610
How long are you going to keep fooling around?

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.270
Where did Shoko go?

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.610
Who knows?

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.770
Bathroom, probably.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.770
Whatever.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.600
This mission is being assigned to you two.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.530
What are those faces for?

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.110
Nothing.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.490
Frankly, I think it's too much for you,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.940
but Tengen-sama asked for you specifically.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.790
Your mission has two goals.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.690
The Star Plasma Vessel

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.140
is the one compatible with Tengen-sama.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.260
You are to escort that girl and erase her.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.270
Escort a brat and erase her?

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.180
That's right.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.740
Have you finally gone senile?

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.520
It is spring.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.270
He's probably got his head full with being the next principal.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.040
Jokes aside, though—

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.530
I'll be the one to decide if I let that off as a joke.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.070
Is this about renewing Tengen-sama's technique?
I'll be the one to decide if I let that off as a joke.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.420
Is this about renewing Tengen-sama's technique?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.940
What's that?

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.530
What?

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.250
Tengen-sama possesses the cursed technique of Immortality,

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.770
but it is not Eternal Youth.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.480
It wouldn't be an issue if all he did was get older,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.830
but after his body ages to a certain point,

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:10.580
the cursed technique begins rewriting his body.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.480
Evolution.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.010
He'll cease to be human and become a higher form of existence.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.920
What's wrong with that?

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.700
Sounds cool.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.330
According to Tengen-sama,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.370
those who reach that state of being have no will.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.770
It means Tengen-sama would cease to be Tengen-sama.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.520
Tokyo Jujutsu High School
All the jujutsu schools,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.970
the barriers that form the foundation of jujutsu society,

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.340
the many barrier techniques of the assistant supervisors...

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.720
They're all being strengthened by Tengen-sama.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.290
Without the aid of his power,

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.310
we could hardly maintain security or clean up after missions.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.120
In the worst-case scenario,

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.630
Tengen-sama could even become a threat to mankind.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.950
That's why, every 500 years, he finds the Plasma Star Vessel—

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.350
someone who is compatible with him—

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.510
and assimilates them, overwriting the information of their body.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.750
By renewing his body,

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.270
he resets his cursed technique back to the start

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.030
and avoids Evolution.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.440
I get it.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.990
It would be fine if he turned into MetalGreymon,

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.480
but we can't have him becoming SkullGreymon.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.270
So we have him start over from Koromon.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.750
What? Yeah, sure, that works.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.060
The Star Plasma Vessel's location has been leaked.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.340
Right now, there are two major groups after the young girl's life.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.990
One is the Curse User Group Q,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.480
which seeks to upend jujutsu society with Tengen-sama's rampage.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.020
The other is the Star Religious Group, also known as the

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.860
"Time Vessel Association," which worships Tengen-sama as a god.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:48.130
Tengen-sama will assimilate the Star Plasma Vessel two days from now.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:53.000
You are to protect the girl until then and ensure that she reaches Tengen-sama!

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.990
If you fail, the effects will ripple throughout even normal society!

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.570
Don't forget that!

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.820
Yeah, but you know,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.710
I get why Curse User Group Q would be after her,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.000
but why would this Star Religious Group want to kill a brat?

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.870
Their object of worship is the pure form of Tengen-sama.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.680
Allowing the Star Plasma Vessel—

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.430
in their minds, an impurity— to blend into him is unforgivable.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.070
The Star Religious Group is an organization of non-sorcerers.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.210
I don't think we need to pay them any mind.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.880
The ones to be wary of are Q.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.050
Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.890
We're the strongest, after all.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.000
That's why Tengen-sama asked for us specifically, right?

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.350
What is it?

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.380
You know, Satoru...

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.670
I've been wanting to say this for a while,

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.200
but you should stop being so full of yourself.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.030
Huh?!

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.790
Especially when you're addressing your superiors.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.390
We might end up meeting Tengen-sama, after all.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.040
You should be more polite and humble.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.270
You'd scare your juniors less, too.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.000
Hah!

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.590
Screw that!

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.740
Come on, Satoru.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.960
Whatever.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.510
I'll bring it up again later.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.130
Coming.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.510
Huh?

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.520
You alive?

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.070
I am, at least.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.030
You think we'll be blamed if the brat died from that?

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.320
Ah

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.880
Don't blame me.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.000
If you must hate someone, hate Tengen.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.030
Q Combatant Kokun
If you must hate someone, hate Tengen.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.510
Q Combatant Kokun

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.260
Wha—
Q Combatant Kokun

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.130
Would you please stop making us stand out?

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.220
We just got chewed out for that this morning.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.680
So this girl is the Star Plasma Vessel?

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.310
I know those uniforms. You're sorcerers from Jujutsu High, right?

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.770
Hand over the kid.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.360
Or I'll kill you.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.390
Can't hear you.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.400
Come closer and talk.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.130
Man, barely safe.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.160
Wonderful.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.160
You're Gojo Satoru, right?

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.120
Q Combatant Bayer
You're famous.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.850
I hear you're strong.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.620
Let me find out if the rumors are true.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.470
I'm down for that, but let's set some rules.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.680
Rules?

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.110
I don't want to get yelled at for going overboard.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.520
So if you cry and apologize, I won't kill you.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.980
That's our rule.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.580
Damn brat.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.040
It's started.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.700
The Star Religious Group doesn't have the power to fight against jujutsu sorcerers.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.610
But they can pay very well.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.390
That I guarantee.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.750
How about it, Zen'in?

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.890
Want to get in on the assassination of the Star Plasma Vessel?

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.680
I'm not a Zen'in anymore.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.500
I took my wife's name.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.470
It's Fushiguro now.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.490
But sure.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.740
Count me in.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.970
Episode 25 Hidden Inventory

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.190
You know how there are some words you can't get out of

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.020
your head, even though they have no connection to you?

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.640
Like "The Privatization of Reclaimed Lands in Perpetuity Act"?

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.500
Yeah! Or like "Corporate Governance."
