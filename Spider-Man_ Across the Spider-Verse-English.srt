1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,910
Let's do things differently this time.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,250
Like, so differently.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,000
His name is Miles Morales.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,880
He was bitten by a radioactive spider.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,930
And he's not the only one.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,220
He hasn't always had it easy.

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,320
And he's not the only one.

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,820
And now he's on his own.

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,500
And he's not the only one.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,380
You think you know the rest.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,800
You don't.

12
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,470
I thought I knew the rest, but I didn't.

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,560
I didn't wanna hurt him.

14
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,060
But I did.

15
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,530
And he's not the only one.

16
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,250
Hey!

17
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,410
Yo, Def Leppard!

18
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,250
Gwen!

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Is the song over?

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,510
- Seems over.\N-  Are you okay?

21
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,470
You don't hang out,\Nand you don't wanna talk.

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,550
I didn't join a band

23
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,350
- so I could talk about feelings.\N- I did.

24
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,850
I joined it\Nso I could hit my feelings with sticks.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
Yo, if you don't tell someone\Nwhat's going on,

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,190
- you're gonna snap.\N- I'm fine.

27
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,520
That's not how someone\Nwho's fine would say that.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,310
They'd say,\N"Great. Thanks. How are you?"

29
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,400
- I'm great. Thanks.\N- Whoa!

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,280
How are you?

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,240
Fine?

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,910
Gwen. Come on.

33
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,660
- I don't get you, man.\N- You're right!

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,080
I play drums.

35
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,330
I always wanted to be in a band.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,380
Guess I just never found the right one.

37
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,840
In this line of work,

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,590
you always wind up a solo act.

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,640
Before Miles...

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,550
- How many did you take?\N- ...there was Peter.

41
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,730
- I think you look great. I don't know.\N- Is this that dangerous menace?

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,600
No, no, no. She seems like a good guy.

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Why wear a mask\Nif you've got nothing to hide?

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,610
All right,\Nno politics at the dinner table.

45
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,940
Thank you, May.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,150
But they didn't really know me.

47
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,820
- And I didn't really know him either.

48
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,620
- Touch him again, Ned.\N-  Gwen, it's okay.

49
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,040
Until it was too late.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,550
-  Hey, Gwen.\N- Hey.

51
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,670
Peter?

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,490
What? No.

53
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,990
No, no, no.

54
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,450
What did you do?

55
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,250
I just wanted to be special.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,960
Like you...

57
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,630
Gwen.

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,590
-  Gwen?\N- Don't worry.

59
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,300
Who's Gwen?

60
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,880
Everything's gonna be okay.

61
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,340
Don't.

62
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,260
- Everything's gonna...\N- Don't go.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,020
Oh, Peter.

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Peter?

65
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,290
I never really made another friend\Nafter that.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Except one.

67
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,250
But he's not here.

68
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,920
And there's no way to get there.

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,010
Pressure mounts

70
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,930
as Captain George Stacy\Nleads the manhunt for Spider-Woman.

71
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,560
Who is she?\NAnd why won't she show her face?

72
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,310
Peter Parker, an innocent young man...

73
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,270
I've known May and Ben Parker\Nfor 12 years.

74
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,270
Peter Parker ate at my table.

75
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,940
He was my daughter's best friend.

76
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,650
And I will not rest

77
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,400
until I find this Spider-Woman.

78
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Hey, hey, hey. How's the band?

79
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,000
Uh... Uh, yeah, great.\NI quit so, you know...

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,090
- You did, huh? Okay.\N- ...thumbs up.

81
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,760
We, uh-- We caught a break\Nin the Spider-Woman case.

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,550
Oh.

83
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
That's good.

84
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,850
We're close.\NI'm telling you, I can feel it.

85
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,230
Me too.

86
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,980
It'll be good for us.

87
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,480
Don't be so sure.

88
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,570
She killed your friend.

89
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,990
- You don't know that.\N- What do you mean? I do know that.

90
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,110
- I was there. She ran from the scene.\N- Maybe she didn't have a choice.

91
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,790
- I got a job to do, Gwen.\N- It won't bring him back.

92
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,210
Uh, I don't wanna argue about this, okay?

93
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,170
Yeah, I can tell.

94
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,840
Say, uh...

95
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,270
too punk rock to give your old man a hug?

96
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,370
All units, possible superhuman event.

97
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,280
Guggenheim Museum.

98
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,410
- Oh. Hey, this could be it.\N- Suspect is Adrian Toomes.

99
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,450
- Also known as the Vulture.\N- So I'll see you later?

100
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,080
We don't know the full scale\Nof the threat yet.

101
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,370
Cool.

102
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,710
Uh, I'll call. I love you.

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,260
49-20, on scene.

104
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,010
We're gonna need\Nall the help we can get.

105
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,720
It's a real mess down here.

106
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,400
This is Captain Stacy. I'm five out.

107
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,900
I need you to look alive.\NGood chance our girl shows up.

108
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,970
Yuri, explain to me how a guy\Nwith a 40-foot wingspan

109
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,430
just waltzed\Ninto the Guggenheim unnoticed?

110
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,810
Hey, it's New York.\NEveryone's got their thing.

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,440
- Do we know what he wants?\N- Do you speak Italian?

112
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,820
- Uh, I'm an Irish cop.\N- Maybe you love pasta or something.

113
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,440
Everybody on my signal!

114
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,610
- Look out for signs of Spider-Woman!

115
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,490
Hey!

116
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,950
Yup, we got our sign.

117
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,410
How's the manhunt for me going?

118
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,620
-  You're under arrest!\N- Good to know!

119
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,210
Vulture!

120
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,300
- Screaming their name usually works.

121
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,100
I guess that worked.

122
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,850
I am the Vulture,\Nthe pinnacle of man's genius.

123
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,690
You're not my Vulture.\NWhat are you, made of parchment?

124
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,730
- What cursed world have you brought me to?

125
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,820
You're glitching, huh? Been there.

126
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,320
- Uh, where you from, bud?\N- I am an artist, an engineer.

127
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,240
Oh, great. A Renaissance man.

128
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,370
Ooh, let me guess.

129
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,290
You were having an espresso

130
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,450
in some old-timey\NLeonardo da Vinci dimension,

131
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,580
and suddenly a portal opens up\Nand you wind up here.

132
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,170
- Am I warm?\N- Yes, that's pretty much it.

133
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,720
Sidebar,

134
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,260
uh, maybe you could stop making a mess\Nof the art museum for no reason?

135
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,260
- You call this art?\N- We're talking about it, aren't we?

136
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,730
I mean, it's more of\Na meta commentary on what we call art,

137
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,400
but it's also art.

138
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,110
Oh, look. It's your cousin.

139
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,580
I wouldn't play with fire, dude.\NYou're kind of made of paper.

140
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,630
- Oh, no.

141
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,240
I'm sorry.\NWho exactly are you supposed to be?

142
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,370
It's classified.

143
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,740
- You're the Blue Panther.\N- No.

144
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,870
- The Caped Blusader?\N- No.

145
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,000
- Dark Garfield.\N- Stop.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,040
Macho Libre.

147
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,410
I'm from another dimension.

148
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,500
You are?

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,170
Wow! Actually, I'm not confused.

150
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,460
- My name is Miguel O'Hara.

151
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,760
I lead an elite strike force dedicated\Nto the security of the multiverse--

152
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,220
- Actually, forget it.

153
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,760
Can you go to any dimension you want\Nwith that watch thing?

154
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,970
- It's much cooler than a watch.\N- Okay. Sensitive.

155
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,890
There is a big flying turkey\Nfrom the Renaissance

156
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,140
I have to bring to justice,\Nso if you don't mind...

157
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,730
It's all right, kid.

158
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,230
I'll take it from here.

159
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,230
Okay, knock yourself out.

160
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,990
Why are you saying it like that?

161
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,610
-  You're not funny!\N-  Eh, I don't know.

162
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,990
Been really fun cleaning up\Nyour shocking mess, by the way.

163
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,040
What mess?

164
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,080
-  Kingpin's collider.\N- What are you guys talking about?

165
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,790
- You shut up.\N- None of your business. Nosy.

166
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,630
We saved the multiverse.

167
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,550
You left a hole wide enough\Nfor guys like him

168
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,300
to randomly get shot\Ninto the wrong dimension.

169
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,390
Now I'm stuck putting everybody\Nback where they belong

170
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,560
before all of time and space collapses.

171
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,600
And don't even get me started\Non Doctor Strange

172
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,270
and the little nerd back on Earth-199999.

173
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,440
Who's Doctor Strange?

174
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,690
Sounds like he maybe\Nshouldn't practise medicine.

175
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,480
- Sorry, captain, can't talk right now.\N- Hey! Hey!

176
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,490
So you want me to handle this one or...?

177
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,790
Okay.

178
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,050
 He's got hammerspace!

179
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,430
LYLA, can you please, you know...?

180
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,890
- Nah, you gotta say it first.

181
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,270
- Call for backup.\N- What?

182
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,440
- Call backup.\N- Come on.

183
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,190
- Please just call for--\N- I already called her.

184
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,610
But I enjoyed that.

185
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,800
Spider-Woman.

186
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,970
Me too.

187
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,260
Are you, uh...?

188
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,430
Oh, this?

189
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,390
We don't know the sex yet.\NMy husband wants it to be a surprise.

190
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,810
He's really corny. But so hot.

191
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,150
Will you adopt me?

192
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,440
- What?\N- What? What?

193
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,900
Guys, can we focus

194
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,440
on the big, fire-breathing threat\Nto time and space, please?

195
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
- Yep, yep, yep.\N-  Right.

196
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,880
- What about her?\N- No.

197
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,210
- We could use the help.\N- No.

198
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,630
- 'Cause she called you Dark Garfield?\N- No.

199
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,760
- Do you say anything but no?\N- No. Yes.

200
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,800
- Why not?\N- You know why.

201
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,300
Enough of this.

202
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,140
Take a good look at my Greek fire\Nfrom my backpack.

203
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,520
Don't let him out!

204
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,400
He'll disrupt the canon.

205
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
-  Go to the ground.\N- Will you get out of here?

206
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,630
We have you surrounded.

207
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,510
-  But I'm a good guy.\N-  You don't look like a good guy.

208
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,550
You're just gonna have to shut up\Nand trust me. No!

209
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,390
Mayday! Mayday! We're hit!

210
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,100
We're headed for the ground!

211
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,140
Clear the building!

212
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,160
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

213
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,870
That's what I was gonna do.

214
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,320
- Hands in the air!

215
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,780
Captain, come on.

216
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,950
- Suspect is armed.\N- With what? I'm out of webs.

217
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,410
Get down on the ground.

218
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,370
Which is it? Hands in the air\Nor get down on the ground?

219
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,710
- You're under arrest.\N- I just saved a bunch of people!

220
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,540
- For the murder of Peter Parker.\N- Come on.

221
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,630
- You have the right to remain silent.\N- You don't understand!

222
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,680
You don't understand.

223
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,460
Dad.

224
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,840
I've thought about telling you.

225
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,340
But you can see why I didn't want to.\NYou can see why I didn't wanna tell you.

226
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,390
I didn't murder Peter.

227
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,350
I didn't know it was him.\NI didn't have a choice.

228
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,600
How long have you been lying to me?

229
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,860
Can you just not be a cop for a second\Nand be my dad here and listen to me?

230
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,990
Do you really think I'm a murderer?

231
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,240
You're in this to help people, right?

232
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,170
Right?

233
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,880
Well, so am I.

234
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,960
And the way to help right now\Nis to listen to me.

235
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,010
Please, Dad.

236
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,130
You're all I have left.

237
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,270
- You have the right to remain silent.\N- What?

238
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,850
Anything you say can and will...

239
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,810
Dad, are you really this afraid of me?

240
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,270
- You have the right to an attorney.\N- Dad, stop!

241
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,730
Don't get any closer.

242
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,530
Hey! What--?

243
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,360
- Dad!\N- Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

244
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,950
Just breathe.

245
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,030
We got you. Right, Miguel?

246
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,460
LYLA, scan this mess.

247
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,170
No further anomalies.

248
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,550
Canon remains intact.

249
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,430
We can't just leave her here.

250
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,180
She's doing this on her own.

251
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,150
I don't know how to fix this.

252
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,910
Yeah.

253
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,620
Well, join the club.

254
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,770
I know he's just a sophomore,

255
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,860
but we wanna get a jump\Non the college conversation, so...

256
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,480
I'm sure he's gonna be here any minute.

257
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,450
He's very serious about his future.

258
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,200
Uh...

259
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,760
- Excuse me, do you have an ATM machine?\N- Around there in the back.

260
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,880
Preferably not chained.

261
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,220
-  What?\N-  Nothing!

262
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,510
This should be simple enough.

263
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,680
Just make a hole...

264
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,060
grab the money.

265
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,810
Nope. That's not right.

266
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,230
Just get...

267
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,570
Uh--

268
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,860
Give me your money.

269
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,530
Where are you, money? Where are you?

270
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,450
Come here!

271
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,530
Oh!

272
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,500
Hey, who left this ATM on the sidewalk?

273
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,290
- Yo, what you doing back there, man?\N- Nothing.

274
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,210
Nothing.\NEverything's cool, man. It's all good.

275
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,460
- Just forgot my PIN number.\N- Get out of here!

276
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,300
- No! Sir! Let me rob you!\N- I'm going to rob your spotted face.

277
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,140
No reason to bring wood into this.

278
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,220
I've never robbed anybody in my life.\NPlease don't make this a bad experience.

279
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,310
"Bad experience"? I run a business here.

280
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,310
I'm like Robin Hood,\Nif he gave to himself.

281
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,560
Oh, wow, is this curry powder?\NSee, I'm a scientist. Or I wa-- I am.

282
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,610
Anyway, you've heard of Alchemax?\NI used to work there.

283
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,940
I was considered handsome\Nby scientists' standards.

284
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,150
I had a little accident.

285
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,910
Give me my foot!

286
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,620
Oh, man.

287
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,990
I'm so sorry.

288
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,460
First of all, I'm not even robbing you.\NThis machine doesn't even belong to you.

289
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,960
- Belongs to the bank, the real criminals.\N- You're the criminal. You're robbing me.

290
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,090
You know, I can't really get a job\Nanywhere anymore, being like this.

291
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,630
So I've turned to a life of crime.

292
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,630
- Why do people say "ATM machine"?\N-  Huh?

293
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,430
- Who said that?\N- The M stands for "Machine."

294
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,850
Spider-Man!

295
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,350
Ow!

296
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,890
Hey, Lenny, how much do I owe you\Nfor this beef patty, man?

297
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,060
Spidey, if you catch him,\Nit's on the house, brother.

298
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,400
- This is real!\N- So are you, like, a cow or a Dalmatian?

299
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,650
I am...

300
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,780
...the Spot.

301
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,040
- We meet again, Spider-Man.

302
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,920
- That's funny to you?\N- Of course not. No.

303
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,580
So is that a costume?

304
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,540
Unfortunately for both of us,\Nthis is skin.

305
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,630
Oh, dang.

306
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,670
You see...

307
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,550
- I'm from your past. One year ago--

308
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,090
- Hold up.

309
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,550
- Oh, come on.\N-  Uh-oh.

310
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,260
- This has been fun.\N- Who you talking to?

311
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,640
- But I really gotta wrap this up.\N- Are you gonna be a while? 'Cause--

312
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,480
Maybe just pay me now.

313
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,690
Okay, let's do this one last time.

314
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,610
- My name is Miles Morales.

315
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,160
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

316
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,740
And for the last year and four months,

317
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,870
I've been\NBrooklyn's one and only Spider-Man.

318
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,790
And things are going great.

319
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,630
- Hey, hey, hey!

320
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,040
You could hurt somebody.

321
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,380
Catching all sorts of bad guys.

322
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,300
Let's go.

323
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,880
Oh!

324
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,050
Can't you act like a regular supervillain\Nso I can catch you?

325
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,230
I designed my new suit\Nwith some fly ambience down the side.

326
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,520
Aunt May moved to Florida.

327
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,480
Done.

328
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,020
I guest-hosted Jeopardy!

329
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,480
Endorsed baby powder.\NApologised for endorsing baby powder.

330
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,730
I made a mistake.

331
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,780
My moustache came in.

332
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,360
Moustache.

333
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,780
And out.

334
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,700
I made another mistake.

335
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,450
Been developing a new twist\Non my venom thing.

336
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

337
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,710
Sorry!

338
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,500
How much longer\Ncan I keep lying about who I really am?

339
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,340
I hear that new Spider-Man\Nis Puerto Rican.

340
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,590
Nah, he seems more Dominican to me.

341
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,930
I mean, would they get it if I told them?

342
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,680
We love you and accept you, even though\Nyou have been lying to us for a year.

343
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,690
Maybe in some other universe.

344
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,060
Sometimes I just wish\NI wasn't the only one.

345
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,940
But I don't dwell on it.

346
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,410
I miss my uncle sometimes.

347
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,250
Miles, I see exactly\Nwhat you're doing there, man.

348
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,790
Even though he turned out\Nto be the Prowler.

349
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,000
I try to do what he told me:

350
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,090
Just keep going.

351
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,550
"Just keep going."

352
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,220
 You're looking at texts?\NThis is the fight of our lives.

353
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,970
- Sorry. Just a second.\N- Okay.

354
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,720
No, no, no. Go ahead. Take the call.

355
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,600
You turn off your phone in a theatre,\Nbut not when you're fighting me?

356
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,390
Ah! "In a minute."

357
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,270
Ah! He wrote it all as one word.\NThat's cute, right? The youth.

358
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,320
-  Okay, that's weird.\N- Whoa!

359
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,820
Oh, my nose!

360
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,700
Sorry. I gotta be somewhere.

361
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,740
- Psych.\N- Whoa!

362
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,990
There's bubbles now. Hold on.

363
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,910
Whoa!

364
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,790
I think this is going great.

365
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,330
Still bubbles on here.

366
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,960
I think it's probably okay.

367
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,420
I love it.

368
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,090
We're figuring it out.\NWe're finding our rhythm.

369
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

370
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,470
Hey, where'd that goose come from? Whoa!

371
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,640
I don't think I want this costume anymore.

372
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,850
Almost there, Mami.

373
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,810
- Smiley-face. Prayer hands.\N-  Oh, my God.

374
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,940
Is this your goo--?\NGet it off me, get it off me!

375
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,320
At the end of the day...

376
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,410
I got you right where I-- Ow!

377
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,580
So aggressive!

378
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,540
...I'm Spider-Man.\NNo one can take that away from me.

379
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,130
Unbelievable. Come back to your nemesis!

380
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,210
Don't escape.

381
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,420
Your costume's too tight in the back,\Nby the way.

382
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,680
- Yo, what's up, man?\N- Uh, I'm writing an essay.

383
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,640
There's a bad guy\Non the Petersen building.

384
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,520
Call the police, tell them to pick him up?

385
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,100
- Sounds like a slippery slope.\N- Just this one time.

386
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,270
It starts with one call,

387
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,690
then it's walkie-talkies,\Nsynchronised watches.

388
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,280
In a month, it'll be a Spider-Signal.\NI'm not your "guy in the chair."

389
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,400
Are those my Jordans?

390
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,280
I can't help it if we're the same size.

391
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,840
You see, every person is a universe.

392
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,220
And my job is to capture\Nyour person's universe

393
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,140
on this piece of paper.

394
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
- That's blank.\N- Exactly.

395
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,730
I have no idea who this kid is.

396
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,690
I don't know if he knows.

397
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,310
He's gotta decide if he's going\Nto commit himself to his future

398
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,570
or whatever he's doing\Ninstead of being here.

399
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,440
Can't have your cake and eat it too.

400
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,360
Unless you bake two cakes.

401
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,160
- Miles?\N- Interest in comedy.

402
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,780
- How's this going? College!\N- Now, son, what do we always say?

403
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,910
"On time means five minutes early."

404
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,250
I know, I know, I know.

405
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,000
I gotta get back to being a great student,\Nso can we make this quick?

406
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,300
Okay.

407
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,460
Miles's grades are pretty good.

408
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,970
A in AP Physics...

409
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,550
That's my little man.

410
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,850
...and AP Studio Art.

411
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,100
He takes after his uncle.

412
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,970
- A-minus in English.\N- She's a tough grader.

413
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,770
And a B in Spanish.

414
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,060
- What?!\N- Whoo! Okay.

415
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,690
- Miles!\N- Are you trying to kill your mother?

416
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,900
Eso no es my fault.

417
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,650
"Esto no es my fault"?\N¿Tú estás tomando la clase en Spanglish?

418
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,110
I missed a few classes.

419
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,150
Oh, just a few classes.\NWell, what's "a few"?

420
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,700
I mean, you know, like...

421
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,280
- Five?\N-  Five?!

422
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Actually, six.

423
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,830
- You're dead.\N- A truant.

424
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,370
- Wait.\N-  Takes after his uncle.

425
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,960
- But I just have a lot going on.\N- All right. We can still salvage this.

426
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,290
I'm sorry, "salvage"?

427
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,380
Miles has a great story to tell.

428
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,090
Having a story at all seems gross.

429
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,760
- Your name is Miles Morales.\N- Correct.

430
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,470
You grew up\Nin a struggling immigrant family.

431
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,260
I'm from Puerto Rico.\NPuerto Rico is part of America.

432
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,430
We own a floor in Brooklyn.\NAh... Struggling?

433
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,100
- Doesn't matter. You're all struggling.\N- I make captain next week.

434
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,900
Now his dream is to attend\Nthe top physics programme in the nation...

435
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,610
- Whatever it takes, we'll do it.\N- ...at Princeton University.

436
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,900
In New Jersey?

437
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,700
No, no, no. That's too far.

438
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,120
New Jersey's too far from New York?

439
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,540
There's great schools in Brooklyn.

440
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,330
Mom, Princeton has the best\Nquantum researchers in the country.

441
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,250
Quantum. Mm-hm.

442
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,210
They're moving electrons\Nacross dimensional thresholds.

443
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,550
- Electrons. Uh-huh.\N- They're studying dark matter!

444
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,510
I don't know what any of that means.

445
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,720
I could help figure out\Nhow to travel to other dimensions.

446
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,550
- Yeah, okay.\N- That sounds like a really good fake job.

447
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,220
Dad, when you were my age,\Nyou followed your dream

448
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,690
and went out on your own\Nto start a business with Uncle Aaron.

449
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,150
- Right?\N- That's different. We used to--

450
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,610
See, when you were born--\NPlus, your mom used to--

451
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,990
Look, life is a journey.

452
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,990
You all got me into this school because\Nyou thought I could do something special.

453
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,080
- And now I think so too.

454
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,660
And the special thing I wanna do is this.

455
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,080
There are people out there

456
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,790
who can literally teach me\Nthe things I wanna learn.

457
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,380
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.

458
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,180
That's your story!

459
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,140
Now just stick to the script.

460
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,930
Miles, are you paying attention?

461
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,850
- Miles, pay attention.

462
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,900
- Ow. That hurt my tailbone.\N-  Are you kidding me?

463
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,230
Ooh. I gotta go. You guys keep talking.\NThis is all great stuff.

464
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,700
Miles, wait.\NDid you order the cake for tonight?

465
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,200
Totally. I'm-- You know, call me--\NI gotta go, all right? Bye!

466
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,950
This kid. I swear,\Nwhat are we gonna do with him?

467
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,870
All units, supervillain event in progress.

468
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,210
- I gotta go too.\N- What? You're gonna leave too?

469
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,540
He leaves, you leave, everybody leaves.\NWhy am I here?

470
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,880
I know. I'm so sorry.\NBut we'll figure it out.

471
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,800
Together.

472
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,800
Wow. Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

473
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
-  He's lying to you.\N- Jeff?

474
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,720
Your son.

475
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,720
He's lying. And I think you know it.

476
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,440
How's your essay?

477
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,810
- Marinating. This is part of my process.\N- Oh? Oh, really?

478
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,320
- I think your guy got away.\N- Thanks, I'm on it.

479
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,110
- You seem really stressed.\N-  I agree.

480
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,900
- You're stretched too thin.\N- Yeah, thanks for the tip.

481
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,360
- That was bad.\N-  I know.

482
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,870
- What's really going on with this kid?\N- I don't know!

483
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,280
- Oh! Hey!\N-  Boom!

484
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,830
- Spider-Man.\N-  Officer Morales! I mean:

485
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,960
-  Officer Morales.\N-  This is not what it looks like.

486
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,460
- Hey! Hey!\N-  Officer--

487
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,880
My kid goes here, man!

488
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
This is fun.

489
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,050
I'm on the PTA. You know how many\Nlemon bars I gotta bake for that?

490
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,220
-  You left in the middle of a fight.\N-  I did not. It was at the end.

491
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,800
-  Are you serious?\N-  It was inconsiderate, super rude.

492
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,720
And a little cocky.

493
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,270
Yeah, you got me agreeing\Nwith the bad guy right now.

494
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,680
"Bad guy"?\NHe's barely a villain of the week.

495
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,770
What'd you call me?

496
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,270
- You realise I'm right here.\N- Come on!

497
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,690
...is under control.

498
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,360
-  Unbelievable.\N-  Wow.

499
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,990
Of course we'd end up back here.

500
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,700
You know, you are just like my son.

501
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,120
I am? I--\NThat's so silly. Imagine that.

502
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,620
-  Back where it all started!\N-  Look out!

503
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,880
The crucible of our connection!

504
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,050
Don't try to wow me with big words.

505
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,180
I do the crossword every day.

506
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,850
-  Is it all coming back to you?\N-  What are you talking about?

507
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,060
The creation event.

508
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
What?

509
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,810
- Ah!

510
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,530
- Yeah.\N- Hey, we got cut off.

511
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:13,110
This is our son we're talking about.\NNothing is more important than family.

512
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,450
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

513
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,450
Destiny brought us here.

514
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,420
- You see now, don't you?\N- I really don't.

515
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,330
I am your nemesis.

516
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,880
Dude, you are not.

517
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,340
You missed.\NYou can't contain the Spot. Ow!

518
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,050
You really don't remember\Nwhat you did to me?

519
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,010
- What I did for you?\N-  Uh... No.

520
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,560
I worked at Alchemax.

521
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,850
I ran a test on this collider

522
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,060
that brought a spider here\Nfrom another dimension.

523
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,520
- Forty-two.\N-  Its home dimension.

524
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,900
It escaped. And it bit you.

525
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,950
My spider made you Spider-Man.

526
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,320
- What?\N- You ran through the cafeteria.

527
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,410
- He took a bagel!\N- You hit me with a bagel.

528
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,750
I've hit a lot of different villains\Nwith a lot of different food.

529
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,790
You make your flippy, little sassy jokes,

530
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,880
and everyone loves them.

531
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,840
But no one knows what it feels like\Nto be on the other side of them.

532
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,920
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

533
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,930
I created you.

534
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,180
You created me.

535
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,890
Spider-Man, why did you create that guy?

536
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,680
I didn't. He's talking crazy.

537
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,600
I was in this collider room\Nwhen you blew it up!

538
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
Because of you...

539
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,240
I lost my job, my life,

540
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,160
my face!

541
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,240
My family won't even look at me.

542
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,700
I made you into a hero.

543
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,960
You made me into this!

544
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,420
Look at me! You did this to me!

545
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,380
Look at me! I'll make you respect me!

546
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,170
Ah! Ow!

547
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,800
I am your neme--

548
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,520
Well, where'd he go?

549
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,060
He kicked his own butt.

550
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,600
You know we're supposed\Nto catch the bad guys, right?

551
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,270
I always do.

552
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,320
- Usually.

553
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,610
- Gutierrez! Get the crane, man.\N-  Yes, sir!

554
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,900
This here is why nobody likes us, man.

555
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,240
-  "Us"?\N- I am trying to do right out here.

556
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,950
- I'm trying too.\N- You need to be a better role model.

557
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,370
I'm a great role model.

558
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,000
Hey, Gutierrez, you can cancel the crane.

559
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,510
I swear, I'll quit my job!

560
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,300
- Do you wanna talk about it?\N- Are you crazy?!

561
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,470
Well, men of your generation\Nignore their mental health too long.

562
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,060
Oh, boy.

563
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
What am I even doing?

564
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,770
'Cause no matter what I do,\Nsomeone always thinks I'm blowing it.

565
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,030
I know the feeling.

566
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,410
So your son.

567
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,700
How's he doing?\NYou think he's gonna figure it all out?

568
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,200
- Honestly?\N- Yeah.

569
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,000
- He's a good kid.\N- Yeah?

570
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,500
It's scary.\NHe says these things that are so smart.

571
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,460
Cool. Well, I should probably--

572
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,670
And then he does these things\Nthat are so stupid.

573
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,720
I just don't want him to mess it up.

574
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,840
Maybe get off the kid's ass.

575
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,060
- I'm sorry, what?\N- What? What? I don't know.

576
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,390
And I hate\Nthat he's not being honest with me.

577
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,020
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.

578
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,690
Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?

579
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,690
I don't-- I don't know.

580
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,570
It's just-- You think you're getting\Npretty good at being a parent.

581
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,440
You think you got it licked.

582
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,030
And then they go and grow up.

583
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,700
I just don't wanna lose him, you know?

584
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:59,880
Well, as an objective observer\Nwith no skin in the game,

585
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,760
I say you gotta let him\Nspread his wings, man.

586
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,680
- Like this.\N- Yeah.

587
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,230
I don't know.

588
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,860
If this isn't nice, what is?

589
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,530
I should go.

590
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,080
Yeah, and catch that holes guy.

591
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,540
Don't worry. I don't think\Nthat guy's gonna show his face again.

592
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,330
What?

593
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,080
Okay.

594
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,880
I think I kicked myself...

595
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,420
into myself.

596
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,220
Well, this is new.

597
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,300
Hello? Hello? Echo, echo. No echo.

598
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,230
I'm going to put my head in that hole.

599
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,070
- Hello.

600
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,030
Ow! Please! Ow, ow, ow!

601
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,490
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

602
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,910
That was cool.

603
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,540
My holes can take me anywhere.

604
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,580
- Whoop.

605
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,750
Excuse me. Hi.

606
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,470
- Sorry to bug you. I know you're busy.\N- What do you want?

607
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,130
I know it's weird. I came out of nowhere.

608
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,010
But I think I'm becoming\Na transdimensional superbeing.

609
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,140
- So?\N-"So?"

610
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,180
I'm literally splitting\Nthe fabric of space and time.

611
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,560
For you, it's just a Tuesday night.

612
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,270
You're acting like weird stuff like this\Nhappens to you all the time.

613
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,070
Can I have some gum?

614
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,690
Oh! Whoa!

615
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,240
Wow.

616
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,080
The power of the multiverse\Nin the palm of my hand.

617
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,700
My holes aren't a curse!\NThey're the answer!

618
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,790
Can you stop talking about your holes?

619
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,540
You're making everyone uncomfortable.

620
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,840
No, no, no. You're gonna love this.\NLook, look, look.

621
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,470
I'm out of spots,\Nwouldn't you know it. Uh...

622
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,510
As you were, gentlemen.

623
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,850
I'm coming for you, Spider-Man!

624
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,970
Take this one step at a time.

625
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,390
Does anybody have\Nthe instructions for this building?

626
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,440
- Oh, no.

627
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,900
Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man,\Npage one, with a decent picture.

628
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,400
- You're right, boss.\N- Shut up.

629
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,480
- Uh-huh.\N- Get out of here!

630
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,980
You got it, boss. I'm on it.

631
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,780
I need a raise.

632
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,450
Miguel, it's Peter. We got an anomaly.

633
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,290
Thank you, Peter. You're one of our best.

634
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,620
- Jess, who's on this?

635
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,670
There you go.

636
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,590
- Have you seen Miles?\N- No.

637
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,100
Nope.

638
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,810
- Have you seen Miles?

639
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,600
- What are you doing?\N-  Speech!

640
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,730
- Okay, everybody.\N- No. I'm terrible at speeches.

641
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,480
Oh, dear God, no.

642
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,530
Rio, come on.

643
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,490
Um... Hi.

644
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,450
And I want you to know,\Nno matter what,

645
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,410
even though we've had our ups and downs,

646
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,000
- I'm so proud of you today, and every day.\N-  Hey.

647
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,500
- Parentheses. Mostly. LOL.\N- Hey.

648
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,880
Hey, Mr Spider-Man,\Nit won't fit on one cake.

649
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,420
Can't you write smaller?

650
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,760
Can't you write shorter?

651
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,640
Come again!

652
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,600
What else can I say about Jeff?

653
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,390
That he was almost 10 pounds as a baby.\NI know you're gonna be embarrassed.

654
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,850
He almost killed his mother.\NLook at those shoulders.

655
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,650
- Oh, no. Okay. That's it.\N-  A big baby.

656
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,400
- Okay, okay.\N- Oh, my God.

657
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,190
He's so funny.

658
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,200
I'll take the mic.\NNo more mics for you, okay?

659
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,450
- Thank you, Rio, for that.\N-  Where is that kid?

660
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,910
I didn't always know\Nwhat I wanted to do in life.

661
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,250
I was pulled in a lot\Nof different directions when I was young.

662
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,420
Me and my brother came up\Nin this neighbourhood.

663
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,750
Just a couple of knuckleheads\Nrunning the streets.

664
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,460
It is I, the Armadillo-- [grunts] Oh!

665
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,130
You guys used\Nto chase us out of your stores.

666
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,930
And now, if you can believe it,\Nit's my job to look out for you.

667
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,560
-And then I had a kid.\N- Stop, thief!

668
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,560
And everything changed for the better.

669
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,940
Oh, no.

670
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,900
I don't even know about giving a toast\N'cause I should be toasting you all.

671
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,190
No, no, no!

672
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,360
So to my brother,\Nwho we miss every single day.

673
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,030
He's definitely up there\Nlaughing at me right now.

674
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,580
They're making me captain, bro.

675
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,370
To my wife, mi amor.

676
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,880
I can't even start\Nbecause I'll never stop.

677
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,340
Have to take the mic from me.

678
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,130
And to my son...

679
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,520
The reason that I do any of this\Nin the first place.

680
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,560
I love you, Miles.

681
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,520
And I will always, always be here for you.

682
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,780
Benny, man. Come on, drop the beat!

683
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,910
I'm gonna kill that kid.

684
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,660
Hey! Congrats, Jeff!

685
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,420
- Hey! Hey, hey.\N- Thank you for coming.

686
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,020
- Hey, Miles. Where have you been?\N- What's up, man?

687
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,400
- You keeping your head up at that school?\N-  Oh, yeah, you bet.

688
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,440
Hola, Miles! Hi.

689
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,900
- Your parents have been looking for you.\N- I don't know why.

690
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,610
- I've just been here the whole time.\N- Oye.

691
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,620
- Ah! Hi.\N- You were supposed to be here at 5.

692
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,540
- I know.\N- You disrespected your dad.

693
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,750
-  Yup. Mm-hm.\N- Missed his beautiful toast.

694
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,620
Come on. Did you even see the cakes?\NThere's some heartfelt messages on them.

695
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,920
That's not what I meant.

696
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,130
Your dad studied for eight months.

697
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,800
Nine. It was like giving birth.

698
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,050
- No, it wasn't.\N- Of course not.

699
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,680
You made us sit in that office\Nand talk to that lady without you.

700
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,390
- There was an emergency.\N- What, a graffiti emergency?

701
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,560
A partying-with-some-friends-\NI've-never-met emergency?

702
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,520
Explain yourself.

703
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,730
Sounds like\Nyou're explaining it pretty well.

704
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,900
- That's funny. Jeff, we got a funny son.\N- I'm not laughing.

705
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,070
- I don't feel grown-up.\N-  Wow, this is a cool shirt.

706
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,990
Okay! Okay, okay.\NHave you checked out the spread?

707
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,040
- Oye!\N- Ah!

708
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,370
Who you running around with?

709
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,290
- Just--\N- Is it Ganke? I never liked him.

710
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,420
Yes, you did.

711
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,670
- He calls me by my first name.\N- Ugh. We hate that.

712
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,920
- I have more friends than just Ganke.\N- Like who?

713
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,970
Well, there's-- There's Peter.

714
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,840
You know, uh, but he left town.

715
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,390
Um, there's-- There's Gwanda.

716
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,930
You know, she also left town.

717
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,440
- Miles, dame un break.\N- Is that Spanglish?

718
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,150
Has it ever occurred to you\Nthat maybe I'm just doing benign, private,

719
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,480
unremarkable things\Nwhen I'm not with you guys?

720
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,570
- Nope.\N- Never.

721
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,110
I am 15 years old.\NI am basically an adult.

722
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,030
- Oh, right.\N- You don't have a driver's licence.

723
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,740
- Neither does Mom!\N- We live in New York

724
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,410
and never plan to leave.

725
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,580
- It's my life.\N- It's not your life.

726
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,000
It's mine and your father's\Nand your abuelos' y abuelas',

727
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,420
who put you in this spot\Nthat I'd give anything to be in.

728
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,340
All right. Whatever, whatever.

729
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,340
"Whatever"?

730
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
- Wow.\N-"Whatever"?

731
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,890
- Do I get to say it? Please tell me I can.\N- Say it.

732
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,100
- You're grounded!\N- What?

733
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,430
- Oh, yeah!\N- For how long?

734
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,600
- A month!\N- Dad. Mom, are you--? Seriously?

735
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,810
Yeah, dead serious.

736
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,940
- You don't understand.\N- You are right.

737
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,240
I have no idea what's going on with you!\NSo why don't you tell me?

738
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,150
- Just listen to me!

739
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,820
Okay, champ, you got it. Go for it.\NSay whatever you wanna say.

740
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,080
What do you got to tell me so bad?

741
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,460
You know what? Never mind.

742
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,260
All right, great, walk away.

743
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,640
Because now you got two months!

744
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,390
That was good, right?

745
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,150
Two months.

746
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,910
I'm Spider-Man. I'm not grounded.

747
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,290
Miles!

748
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:40,960
Miles!

749
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,960
You got a minute?

750
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,220
Oh! Whoa!

751
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,300
- How did you get--?

752
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,220
How did you get--? How have you been?

753
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,760
Uh, I've been good.

754
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,390
I've been-- Yeah, just great. Look at you.

755
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,060
You, uh-- You grew, huh?

756
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:00,860
- Had a little growth spurt?\N- Uh, yeah. Your hair has gotten pinker.

757
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,570
- Is this the room you grew up in?\N- It is. Um...

758
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,860
- But my dorm room is very adult.

759
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,490
Cool. Yeah, no, I used to play with these\Nwhen I was younger too.

760
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:12,080
- Uh, that's a collectible.\N- I used to have this one.

761
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,790
- An extremely rare, highly sought--\N- Why is it still in the package?

762
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,960
Eee! Um...

763
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,130
That's fine.

764
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,460
- Are these your drawings? They're good.\N- Hey. What? No.

765
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,680
Wow, there's so many.

766
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,260
Missed you too.

767
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,890
So, what are you doing here?

768
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:39,650
I mean, I thought I'd never see you again.

769
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,190
Wanna get out of here?

770
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,530
I'm grounded.

771
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,110
Bummer.

772
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,490
Is Spider-Man grounded?

773
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,080
Um...

774
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,290
I mean, I...

775
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,090
Miles?

776
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,260
Your dad's ready to listen now.

777
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,470
That's three months!

778
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,440
Wait, hold on.

779
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,400
There's an elite society\Nwith all the best Spider-People in it?

780
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,570
- Okay, so there's this lady, Jess Drew.\N- Uh-huh?

781
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,070
- She rides a motorcycle.\N- Motorcycle?

782
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,780
Oh, my gosh,\NI'm learning so much from her.

783
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,780
Oh, yeah. I've learned a lot of stuff too.

784
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,570
I've levelled up my whole thing. See?

785
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,740
-  Oh, yeah?\N- Yeah.

786
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,490
-  Let's see it, then.\N- Let's go.

787
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,580
Thread the needle.

788
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:42,630
Whoa!

789
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,960
Easy.

790
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,670
And Miguel.

791
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,630
- The whole thing was his idea.\N-  Right.

792
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,640
And who's Miguel?

793
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,180
Oh, he's like a\Nninja-vampire-Spider-Man but a good guy.

794
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,100
A vampire good guy.\NI'd pay good money to see that.

795
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,230
- So how long ago did they invite you?\N- Only like a few months ago.

796
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,110
-"Months" is kind of a long time.\N-  Okay, this one counts for two.

797
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,820
Ha, ha!

798
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,910
Look at you.

799
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,580
Look at me.

800
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,620
Keep the change.

801
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,540
- So this club.\N- Look at that dum-dum.

802
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,080
What kind of stuff do you do?

803
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,710
Guy in the stripes, ten points.

804
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,880
We're trying to keep the multiverse\Nfrom collapsing.

805
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,460
I thought we did that already.

806
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,380
Like, last week we had this mission\Nto some Shakespeare dimension.

807
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,130
-  What?\N- And Hobie and I just, like--

808
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,890
-  Who's Hobie?\N-  Oh, my gosh, you would love him.

809
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,010
He lets me crash\Nin his dimension sometimes.

810
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,310
What does that mean,\Nyou stay overnight or...?

811
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,270
Anyway, they're pretty strict\Nabout where I go,

812
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,400
or I really would have come\Nto see you sooner.

813
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,730
Right. So, uh-- So why'd you come now?

814
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,150
Don't do that.

815
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:56,070
Hey, Gw-- Uh, Gwen?

816
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,080
Where'd you go?

817
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,450
Where did she go?

818
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,510
-  Ah!\N- Oh, hey. There you are.

819
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,350
- What were you doing?\N- Waiting for you.

820
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,780
No, it's not the Greek burger place.

821
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,530
- This is a cool thinking spot.\N-  Right?

822
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:41,620
Who needs a treadmill when you have\Nthe Williamsburgh Bank Building?

823
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,830
- So, uh, you and your dad.

824
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,710
You still haven't talked?

825
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,210
What exactly would we talk about?

826
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,670
"Hey, Dad, how have\Nthe last few months been?

827
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,510
You still think\NI murdered my best friend?"

828
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,220
I don't know.

829
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,100
I mean, my parents--\NI mean, maybe if I told them--

830
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,020
Don't.

831
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,230
Trust me on that.

832
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,700
Well...

833
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,120
Maybe some things\Nare supposed to be just for us.

834
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,790
Hm.

835
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,340
That's a nice way to think about it.

836
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,050
I'm just a really\Nemotionally intelligent guy.

837
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,140
Beyond my years.

838
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,980
It really is always so great\Nto talk to you.

839
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,900
- Yeah?\N- Yeah.

840
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,190
I mean, how many people\Ncan you talk to about this stuff?

841
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,650
You don't even know.

842
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,990
What?

843
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:08,460
You're the only friend\NI've ever really made after Peter died.

844
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,250
Other than Hobie, right?

845
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,590
- That's different.\N- Yeah? How's that?

846
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,760
I don't know.

847
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,890
You and me, it's...

848
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,640
We're the same.

849
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:28,230
In the important ways, you know?

850
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,820
In every other universe,\NGwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man.

851
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,120
And in every other universe,

852
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,410
it doesn't end well.

853
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,260
Well, there's a first time\Nfor everything, right?

854
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,620
- Mmm! Oh, wow. Feelings make me hungry.\N- Oh, yeah,

855
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,410
these plátanos are\Njust deep-fried feelings.

856
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,920
She looks old enough to vote.

857
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,380
I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish.

858
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, qué barbaridad.

859
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,300
This keeps you from glitching\Nin other dimensions?

860
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,380
Yeah. Pretty cool.

861
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,720
What's it gonna take\Nfor Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?

862
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,810
I'll put in a good word.

863
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,350
I'm just saying, if I had a watch,\NI could come with you.

864
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,730
- Miles, look--\N- I did save the multiverse.

865
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,980
It's a really small, elite strike force.

866
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,650
I can turn invisible.\NI have, like, electric powers.

867
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,440
- There aren't a lot of slots.\N- Think about it.

868
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,610
Ah, right.

869
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,610
Look, if it was up to me, you--

870
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:06,240
I know. I know, I know.

871
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:09,870
Oh, no. No, no.

872
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,450
- Don't do that. Miles!\N- All right.

873
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,080
- It's, uh, really delicate.\N- Geez.

874
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,380
Sorry. I didn't mean to, um, snap.

875
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,460
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.

876
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,210
- Hello! Hi.

877
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,340
- Oh, boy.\N- I'm Miles's mom.

878
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,430
Rio! Hi! I've heard so much about you.

879
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,680
You're using my first name. Okay.

880
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,600
This is nice.\NWe found it in Miles's room, so...

881
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,020
- I guess you must've been there, huh?\N- And you must be Jeff.

882
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,060
She called me Jeff.\NThat's very sweet. "Jeff."

883
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,980
You must mean Lieutenant Morales.

884
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,570
Soon to be Captain Morales.

885
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,030
Ah! Captain.

886
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,490
Gwanda and I are friends from school.

887
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,160
- Yeah, we were just catching up.\N- Oh...

888
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,490
Don't take him from me.

889
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,410
Mom.

890
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,710
I'm just kidding.\NHe's grounded, so you can't.

891
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,130
- Don't break his heart.\N- Mom!

892
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,630
- Alpha Squad, Zero Red Spider Alert.\N- Shoot, I have to go.

893
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,460
- Really?\N- Yeah, I forgot to get my steps in.

894
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,970
Really, really wish I could stay longer.

895
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,380
I'm sorry.

896
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,010
Goodbye.

897
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,310
Yeah, bye.

898
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,180
I can hear you being quiet, Mom.

899
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,600
I, um...

900
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,770
I hope I didn't ice your game, man.

901
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,730
No one my age says those words\Nin that order, Mom.

902
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,990
It's just hard to see my little man\Nnot be my little boy all the time.

903
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,700
Yeah.

904
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,500
Papá, you know you can tell me anything.

905
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,470
Well...

906
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
I'm...

907
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,410
I'm sorry I was late.

908
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:07,960
Go.

909
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,970
She seems like a nice girl.

910
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,470
- Is this a trick?\N- It's not a trick.

911
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:19,310
Geez.

912
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,310
What are you--?

913
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,270
Let me fix you. Just...

914
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,690
For years I've been taking care\Nof this little boy, right?

915
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,570
Making sure he's loved,

916
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,570
that he feels like he belongs\Nwherever he wants to be.

917
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,740
He wants to go out into the world\Nand do great big things.

918
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,540
And what I worry about most...

919
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,670
is they won't look out for you like us.

920
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,380
They won't root for you like us.

921
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,590
So here's the deal.

922
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,140
Wherever you go from here,

923
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,220
you have to promise to take care\Nof that little boy for me.

924
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,350
Make sure he never forgets\Nwhere he came from.

925
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,860
And he never doubts that he's loved.

926
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:14,610
And he never lets anyone at those big,\Nfancy places he's gonna be in

927
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,030
tell him that he doesn't belong there.

928
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:22,330
And when he comes home,\Nand he better come home...

929
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,830
you're gonna be early,

930
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,500
and you're gonna be holding\Na normal, nice cake.

931
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:30,920
Yeah, okay.

932
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,130
You gotta promise, Miles.

933
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,930
I promise.

934
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,680
Just...

935
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,720
- don't get lost.\N- Mm-hm. Okay.

936
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,560
All right.

937
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,440
Cool.

938
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,860
Now go. Get out of here.

939
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,830
And when you come back,\Nyou're still grounded.

940
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:01,990
- Ha, ha!

941
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,410
Yeah, I'm smiling like it's a joke,\Nbut it's true.

942
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:05,750
Yeah, I figured.

943
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,580
See you later.

944
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,500
With a cake.

945
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,560
Shoot.

946
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,270
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, the car!

947
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,950
Shoot.

948
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,290
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot.

949
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,720
- Show me what happened.\N-  Replay commencing.

950
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,890
Spots. That's the thing.\NI need more spots!

951
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:48,020
Ha! Oh, my gosh. It was right under\Nwhere my nose would've been.

952
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,770
I just need a little bit more\Ndimensional juice or whatever.

953
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:51,940
- Shoot.\N- Shoot!

954
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,480
Never came up with a good name.\NBranding was never my strong suit.

955
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,900
The city power line\Nto my micro collider prototype

956
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,900
could generate a little more\Nconcentrated dark energy.

957
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,070
Shoot.

958
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,320
This is what I love about science!

959
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,410
Shoot!

960
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,450
I just need enough to get me somewhere\Nwith a full-size collider.

961
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:15,000
And, Spider-Man, I'll make you pay\Nfor everything you took away from me.

962
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,710
All right, this is gonna work.

963
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,630
Or vaporise me\Nand everything in this building,

964
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,090
which would not be good.

965
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,260
- Shoot.\N- Shoot.

966
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,400
Oh, man.

967
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,870
- Shoot.\N- Shoot.

968
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,910
Replay complete.

969
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,960
Why, why, why?

970
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,920
- Gwen, Gwen, Gwen!\N- Gwen. Hi.

971
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,630
Whatcha doing?

972
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:01,300
Nothing. Uh, good. All good.\NYeah, everything's good.

973
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,220
Bye.

974
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,470
Where's the bad guy\Nyou were supposed to monitor?

975
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:06,970
He just stepped out for a moment.

976
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,810
- Dude!\N- He's just some villain of the week.

977
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,220
- LYLA!\N- Oh! We don't need--

978
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,520
Tracking...

979
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,940
Hey, look, I got him. Nope, never mind.

980
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,810
Hold on. Slippery guy.

981
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:18,610
- Did you go see your little friend?\N- What? No.

982
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,820
-  Miles?\N- I mean...

983
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,240
Are you kidding me?

984
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,070
- Only briefly. From afar.\N- How far?

985
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,280
Like, you know, about this:

986
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,290
- About this far.\N- That's way too close.

987
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:30,740
Girl!

988
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,160
Look, I had to know how he was.

989
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,000
- I honestly can't with you.\N- I know I messed up, okay?

990
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,880
He can't be part of this.

991
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,130
I know.

992
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,010
- I'll never see him again. All right?\N-  No kidding.

993
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,890
- Hey, guys? He's making his own portals.\N- What?

994
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,310
He can jump wherever he wants.\NHe could be a total canon killer.

995
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,600
You said he was the villain of the week.\NDo you know how bad this is for you?

996
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,890
Every dimension he stops at\Nhas an Alchemax.

997
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,560
- What's he up to, Gwen?\N- I don't know.

998
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,060
He's making himself more powerful\Nso he can beat me.

999
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,650
Amazing. My star pupil, everyone.

1000
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,280
I'll get him, okay? I can get backup.

1001
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,700
If Miguel finds out I let you come--

1002
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,330
Don't tell Miguel. He'll kick me out and--

1003
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,120
What if he sends me home?

1004
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,500
I got him. Earth-50101.

1005
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,540
What do you wanna do?

1006
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,420
You never made a mistake?

1007
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:24,010
Never got too close to someone?

1008
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,090
I did.

1009
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,720
But I got over it.

1010
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,640
Alert the local Spider.\NTell him Gwen will meet him there.

1011
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,560
I'm on it.

1012
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,190
- Thank you. I won't let you down again.\N- Okay. You're welcome. Shut up.

1013
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,940
You got an hour to fix this.

1014
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,280
Or I can't help you.

1015
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:12,640
Goodbye, Miles.

1016
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,460
- Sorry. Congratulations!

1017
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,060
You see that? This is incredible.

1018
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:38,720
- I'm like a new person.\N-  Where did you go?

1019
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,560
In the mirror,\NI wouldn't recognise myself.

1020
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,190
-  Stay still.\N- I'd envy that person I was looking at.

1021
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,560
-  I have eyes on the anomaly.\N-  Try getting hands on him.

1022
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,940
Stop hovering. You're hovering.

1023
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,530
Hello, pardon me, locals.

1024
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:51,240
Wow, four on there. That's very dangerous.

1025
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,400
That looks good.

1026
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,370
- Which way to Alchemax? Oh!

1027
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,160
It's a place with a big collider--

1028
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,120
- Hey, cow guy! "Moo-ve" over!\N-  That's the best you could do?

1029
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,790
-  Gwen! I'm here to help!\N- Miles, are you--?

1030
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:07,090
Whoopsie-daisy.\NYou weren't expecting that, were you?

1031
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:10,010
-  Oh, no!\N-  Neither was I. I'm in the zone!

1032
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:14,550
-  I got you!\N- Did you follow me?

1033
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,510
No, I just saw where you went\Nand went there without you knowing.

1034
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:21,810
- You're not supposed to be here!\N- What are you talking about? I'm helping--

1035
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,110
No! No, no, no!

1036
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:30,440
Whoa!

1037
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,490
I shouldn't have ever come to see you.

1038
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,030
Dang.

1039
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,420
Hey, who's the new guy?

1040
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,380
Hey, Pav.\NHe's Miles and he wasn't invited.

1041
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,050
Oh!\NYou weren't invited and you came anyway?

1042
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,720
- Right?\N- New guy must be in love with you.

1043
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,840
-  Okay, whoa.\N-  No.

1044
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,010
- I'm not.\N- I'm very good at reading people.

1045
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,470
-  He's not.\N-  Who are you?

1046
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,180
-  Glad you asked, new guy.\N- I'm not a new guy.

1047
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,770
My name is Pavitr Prabhakar,\Nand for the past six months--

1048
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,810
Six? And even he got a watch?

1049
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:07,810
- Yeah, uh...\N- Being Spider-Man is so easy.

1050
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,110
I wake up, skip the workout,

1051
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,860
because I'm naturally buff\Nand I don't wanna get too big.

1052
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,610
Do almost nothing with my amazing hair.

1053
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,110
You don't use any product at all?

1054
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,910
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics.

1055
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:19,740
Then I swing by school.\NDon't really have to try, but I do anyway.

1056
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,660
Fight a few bad guys,\Nfeed a few street dogs,

1057
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,950
quick break for a cup of chai\Nwith my Maya Auntie--

1058
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:26,500
- I love chai tea.\N- What did you just say?

1059
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,540
"Chai tea"?

1060
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,750
"Chai" means "tea," bro.\NYou're saying "tea" tea.

1061
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:33,300
Would I ask you for a "coffee" coffee\Nwith "cream" cream?

1062
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,220
I'm so sorry.

1063
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,180
Then I hang out\Nwith my girlfriend, Gayatri.

1064
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,550
She's an extremely classy teenager.

1065
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,850
Hey, girl. Tonight, I was thinking--

1066
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,060
Hello, Police Inspector Singh.

1067
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,140
This is your daughter. I do not know her.

1068
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:50,310
To top it off, I live in the best possible\NSpider-Man city, Mumbattan.

1069
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:53,440
Quick tour. This is where the traffic is,\Nthis is where the traffic is.

1070
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,950
Traffic here too. This is where\Nthe British stole all of our stuff. Whoa!

1071
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,120
-  Hello, Spider-Man.\N-  Hi.

1072
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,620
-  Hey.\N-  Not you.

1073
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,080
You talking to him or me or him?

1074
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,870
-  Think he means me.\N-  Yeah. Him.

1075
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:07,620
I got this, guys.

1076
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,250
- Huh?\N- Wow. How are you?

1077
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,750
- Can you tell I levelled up my game?

1078
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:15,210
I'm on a journey of self-improvement.

1079
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,970
And you came to India.

1080
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:20,470
That's a Western culture cliché.\NDon't Eat, Pray, Love me, bro.

1081
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,890
I did not mean it like that.

1082
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:24,520
Let me guess, you're gonna ask me\Nabout saffron and cardamom

1083
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,060
and naan bread,\Nwhich is the same as saying "bread" bread,

1084
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,810
which is the same as saying "chai tea."

1085
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,860
-  Oh, I love chai tea.\N-  No!

1086
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:35,780
Come on, man! I think maybe\Nwe got off on the wrong foot.

1087
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,070
Let's just talk about this.

1088
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:40,740
Fine. You made me feel empty,\Nlike I had a hole inside of me.

1089
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,950
We all have holes.

1090
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,740
But now I found out\Nwhat to fill that hole up with.

1091
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,160
More holes!

1092
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,000
That doesn't make any sense!

1093
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,040
It will.

1094
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,130
I'm okay. I'm good.

1095
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,630
- Don't worry.\N-  We won't.

1096
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,710
This romantic tension is so palpable.

1097
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,170
If Spot gets more holes...

1098
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:59,470
-  Will they, won't they?\N- ...he'll be unstoppable!

1099
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,300
- We can't let him get to--\N-  Alchemax?

1100
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:03,800
See? How can you guys even concentrate?

1101
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,060
Hey, does he know about Hobie?

1102
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,480
- What should I know about Hobie?\N- Oh, looks like he did not know.

1103
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,480
Boop.

1104
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:19,070
Go away. Go away.\NSee you later. Thanks for coming.

1105
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,700
Would you please deactivate\Nthis strong barrier?

1106
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,660
It can't be turned off\Nuntil the collider sequence is complete.

1107
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,040
The collider sequence? Oh, man.

1108
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:33,170
-  You need to stop!\N-  You don't know what you're doing!

1109
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,170
I'm about to be so much more\Nthan a villain of the week.

1110
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,920
I'm sorry I called you that, okay?\NYou're a great villain.

1111
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,380
Oh, not yet, I'm not.

1112
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:44,350
-  Initialising collider.\N- No!

1113
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,930
How's it going now?

1114
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:53,270
Great. Anyone got any ideas?

1115
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:55,610
Oh, I have so many, but none for this.

1116
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,280
Stand back.\NI've been working on something new.

1117
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:14,080
-  How long does this usually take?\N-  Just give me a second.

1118
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,630
Do you want us to do something,\Nor do we just stand here?

1119
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,300
Are you charging it, or--?

1120
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,340
No. I'm absorbing it\Nso I can shoot it back.

1121
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,630
-  Looks like you're charging.\N-  Does this have a name?

1122
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:25,800
Hold your questions\Nuntil I'm done breaking this!

1123
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,140
Just let me do this!

1124
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,310
Oi, oi!

1125
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,200
- Hobie!\N-  Hobie, my guy!

1126
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,820
-  Hobie?\N-  Look at that, another one.

1127
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,410
I love how many different variations\Nof you guys there are.

1128
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:51,120
- Man-like, Pav! Big stepper! Yeah, mate!\N- What's this dude saying?

1129
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,330
It's English for "We get\Nalong great, and we're close friends."

1130
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,920
Is this the younger from 1610?

1131
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,250
Do you understand this guy?

1132
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,000
Hobie, thanks for breaking the shield!

1133
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,380
I loosened it.

1134
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,470
Bit of advice.\NUse the palm, not just your fingers.

1135
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,390
What's up with your suit?\NIs he bleeding from his armpits?

1136
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,640
Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles.

1137
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,970
Hi. I've never heard of you\Nbecause Gwen barely ever mentions you.

1138
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:13,980
A'ight, my name's Hobie, Hobie Brown.\NI was bitten by a--

1139
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,730
Wouldn't you like to know?\NYou know what I mean?

1140
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:19,270
For the last three years, I've been\Nthe one and only-- Wait, wait, wait.

1141
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:21,480
You think I'm gonna show you\Nmy secret identity? Come out of it.

1142
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,110
That is, when I'm not playing shows,\Nantagonizing fascists,

1143
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:27,990
staging unpermitted political actions\Nslash performance-art pieces,

1144
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:30,280
or having a laugh at the pub\Nwith the mandem.

1145
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,540
I'm not a role model.\NI was briefly a runway model.

1146
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,460
I hate the a.m. I hate the PM.\NI hate labels.

1147
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,580
I'm not a hero\Nbecause calling yourself a hero

1148
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,540
makes you a self-mythologizing,\Nnarcissistic autocrat.

1149
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,250
Come on! I thought you hated labels.

1150
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,340
Gwendy, you left your jumper\Naround my place.

1151
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,380
- What's a jumper?\N-  It's a sweater.

1152
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,300
- How many sweaters do you have?\N- That's not mine, I'm sure.

1153
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,600
-  And your toothbrush.\N-  Wait, what?

1154
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,600
-  Are those my Chucks?

1155
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,520
-  Y'all make a heck of a team.\N-  I don't believe in teams.

1156
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,650
Aren't you in a band?

1157
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:01,110
I don't believe in consistency.

1158
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,030
This guy's killing me.

1159
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:06,650
This is gonna be good for us, Spider-Man.

1160
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,030
You and me, we're finally\Ngonna live up to our potential.

1161
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,700
You'll finally have\Na villain worth fighting.

1162
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,700
And I won't be just a joke to you!

1163
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,760
You're not a joke!

1164
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,930
- Right, gang?\N-  Absolutely.

1165
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,050
-  Completely unamusing!\N-  I don't believe in comedy!

1166
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,760
Just kidding!

1167
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,180
See? No one here thinks you're a joke!

1168
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,770
-  They won't after this.\N-  No!

1169
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,900
Wow. That was another easy adventure\Nfor Spider-Man.

1170
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,820
-  No, no, no!\N-  No, no, no!

1171
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,590
I'm coming!

1172
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,770
What was that?

1173
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:20,940
Our future.

1174
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:27,400
I'm gonna take everything from you,\Nlike you took everything from me.

1175
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:30,610
What?

1176
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:34,200
See you back home, Spider-Man.

1177
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,910
Miles. Miles!

1178
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:41,460
You okay? We gotta go.

1179
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,170
Oi, oi, liven up, mate.\NNo time to get dizzy.

1180
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,220
Everyone, chalo, chalo!

1181
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,820
We'll clear the path.\NYou slow down that building.

1182
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,980
I'll do it.\NBut not because you told me to.

1183
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,330
Everybody, run!

1184
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:36,760
Watch out!

1185
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:14,880
Gayatri!

1186
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:17,300
Gayatri! No!

1187
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,980
Gwen, heads up.

1188
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,020
Markers are predicting\Nan incoming canon event.

1189
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,320
So tread carefully.

1190
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:32,940
I'm on it.

1191
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,200
Somebody, help!

1192
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,120
- Hurry, everyone! This way, quickly!\N-  Help!

1193
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,040
Inspector Singh!

1194
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,130
I can do both!

1195
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:59,180
-  I got him, I got him!\N-  Miles!

1196
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,510
Don't worry.\NThread the needle, ring the bell, right?

1197
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:04,020
- It's too dangerous.\N- I'll be okay, I promise.

1198
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,310
Miles!

1199
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:17,610
Miles!

1200
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:22,490
No! No.

1201
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:35,880
You're all right.

1202
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,300
I promised.

1203
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,020
Are you okay? I was so worried.

1204
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,940
I mean, you seem like a nice young woman\Nthat I do not know.

1205
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,440
Gayatri!

1206
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,360
Not bad, right?

1207
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,120
Right.

1208
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,160
I've never seen him so emotional.

1209
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,410
Excellent job.

1210
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,140
Man-like, Miles! My guy!

1211
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:27,060
Easy.

1212
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,360
So, what do you think?

1213
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:38,940
What I always think.

1214
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:40,950
You're amazing.

1215
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:45,870
We make a good team. Yeah?

1216
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,870
Yeah.

1217
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,920
Guys, what's that?

1218
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,880
It's a metaphor for capitalism.

1219
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,430
It's a lot worse than that.

1220
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,770
Okay, guys, secure the area,\Nclear all civilians,

1221
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:13,980
and let's contain this quantum hole.

1222
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,940
Hey, I'm Miles.\NWe met before, when I was invisible.

1223
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,400
I know who you are.

1224
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:23,860
Is everything going to be okay?

1225
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,040
Okay, let me explain.

1226
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,880
Miguel wants you back at HQ.

1227
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,170
- Miles was just about to head out.\N- All of you.

1228
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:42,840
- I don't follow orders, neither does he.\N- I'm invited to HQ? Whoo!

1229
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:59,650
How are you even cooler under your mask?

1230
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,320
I was this cool the whole time.

1231
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,380
Hey, over here.

1232
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,720
Yo, this place is wild.

1233
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,140
-  Any sign of Spot?\N-  Let me ask.

1234
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,640
Anybody spot Spot?

1235
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,640
- Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes?\N- Now that you mention it.

1236
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,940
Well, you know what they say,\Nwe need to run a spot check.

1237
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:41,070
-  This is unbelievable.

1238
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,190
- This is the lobby.\N- Oh.

1239
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:46,910
Welcome to Spider-Society.

1240
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:57,920
It's a bit much, innit?

1241
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,540
What happened to that small,\Nelite strike team?

1242
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,340
A lot of these are part-time.

1243
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,720
Gwendy, how much have you told him, hm?\NAbout his place in all this?

1244
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:08,640
A little.

1245
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:12,430
- Maybe not enough.\N- Here.

1246
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:14,810
My own watch!

1247
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:17,650
It's a day pass.\NThis just keeps you from...

1248
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:19,900
...doing that.

1249
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:23,650
-  Hey, Gwen.\N- Hey, Peter.

1250
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:24,820
Hey, I'm Miles.

1251
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:26,570
-  Hey, Gwen.\N- Hey, Peters.

1252
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:27,660
I'm a new recruit.

1253
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:31,490
Peter, take a team to the transport deck\Nto help deal with this Spot mess.

1254
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:34,200
- I wouldn't call it a mess.

1255
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,500
- More like a success in progress.\N- Ben, I need--

1256
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,420
Sorry, I can't talk right now.\NI'm thinking about my past.

1257
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:42,290
Actually, we need you here\Nfor some reason.

1258
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:45,920
That was a particularly harrowing memory.

1259
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,090
- Is he okay?

1260
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,840
- Ah!\N- Howdy. Name's Web-Slinger.

1261
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,560
- Why does the horse need a mask?\N-  To conceal her face.

1262
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,430
Giddy up!

1263
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,140
-  Who is in these laser cages?

1264
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,230
Anomalies. Folks who wound up\Nin the wrong dimension.

1265
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,110
We kick their butts and send them home.

1266
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,570
They're not very interesting.

1267
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:05,730
- We got a bunch of Doc Ocks.\N- That's interesting.

1268
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,400
A Moosterio. Ms Sterio.

1269
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,280
- Video game guy.\N-  I love video games!

1270
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,700
- Another video game guy.\N- Are you talking to me?

1271
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,910
Typeface.

1272
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:16,700
- Go to Helvetica, Spider-Man!\N- Bold.

1273
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,500
An interesting Kraven, a boring Rhino.

1274
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,620
A Prowler.

1275
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,540
- Prowler?\N-  Not your Prowler.

1276
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,670
Hey.

1277
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,710
Hey.

1278
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,430
- It's rude to stare.\N- Caught that one myself.

1279
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:34,390
- I slipped.\N- You? I did all the work.

1280
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:36,310
How many missions\Nhave you been on together?

1281
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,100
- Not that many.\N- Couple dozen.

1282
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,890
That's cool. Sorry.

1283
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:45,570
- I'm Spider-Man.\N- Oh, no way! All of us are.

1284
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:48,570
- Can we just keep moving?\N- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you?

1285
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,280
I'm an avatar.

1286
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,280
My body is back in my parents' dimension,

1287
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,620
chilling in a gaming chair\Nand eating Fritos.

1288
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,700
Right, because you don't listen.

1289
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,250
Here is better.

1290
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,330
I hear that.

1291
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:02,960
What does that do?

1292
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,380
Apart from having a great name?

1293
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,750
- The Go Home Machine.\N- What'd I say, eh?

1294
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,840
I voted against it.

1295
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,840
It detects whatever dimension\Nyour DNA is from

1296
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,180
and sends you there.

1297
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,720
It's super humane and not creepy.

1298
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:18,180
See you, dawg. Don't come back.

1299
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,560
We should go.\NWe don't wanna keep the boss waiting.

1300
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,770
- See you around?\N- Let's go!

1301
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:26,070
- Good luck out there, man.\N- Okay, bye!

1302
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:27,400
Miguel sounds hangry.

1303
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,820
He likes those empanadas\Nfrom the cafeteria.

1304
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:30,950
Don't ask me why.

1305
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,490
My name is Miguel O'Hara.

1306
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,450
I'm this dimension's one\Nand only Spider-Man.

1307
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:42,920
At least, I was.

1308
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:48,210
But I'm not like the others.

1309
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:53,090
I don't always like what I have to do.

1310
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,510
But I know I have to be the one to do it.

1311
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,520
I've given up too much to stop now.

1312
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,060
Whoa, yo.

1313
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,060
Bet this doesn't even do anything.

1314
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,610
Maybe it did\Nbefore you ripped it out of a wall.

1315
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:12,860
It's propaganda, bruv.\NTo distract you from the truth.

1316
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,660
And what's that?

1317
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,530
I ain't got a Scooby Doo.\NThat's what they want.

1318
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:25,370
- Why you wanna be part of this lot?\N-  To get a watch.

1319
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:27,710
- Make your own watch.\N- Pssh.

1320
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:30,300
Bet you got a nice setup, eh?\NNice parents.

1321
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:33,470
They're fine.\NI mean, we got in a fight, but...

1322
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,890
They just want what's best for me, so...

1323
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:39,470
- That's a bloody shame.\N- Why?

1324
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:42,390
'Cause you're not ready\Nfor everybody else.

1325
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,560
-  We did it this time!\N-  Okay, okay, mija.

1326
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,610
Good job.

1327
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:58,780
Listen to me, bruv. Whole point\Nof being Spider-Man is your independence.

1328
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,700
Being your own boss.\NYou don't need all this.

1329
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,080
- Then why are you here?\N- Looking out for my drummer, is all.

1330
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,870
I want to be in a band. I--

1331
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:09,500
I wanna see my friends,\Nand I need a watch to do that.

1332
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,920
Guys, come on.

1333
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,510
All right. Squashed.

1334
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:16,260
Don't enlist till you know\Nwhat war you're fighting.

1335
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,080
Yeah, I know it's slow.

1336
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,990
But it's his thing.

1337
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:47,750
Miguel O'Hara, meet Miles Morales.

1338
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,130
Hey!

1339
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:51,500
I speak Spanish.

1340
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,310
-  I'm excited to get going.\N-  Oh. Great.

1341
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,560
- I have new ideas on how to catch Spot.\N- Oh. Wow. Uh-huh.

1342
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,480
He just wants to be\Ntaken seriously, like we all do. Whoa!

1343
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:10,190
He's worried about Spot.

1344
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:11,610
I'll worry about Spot!

1345
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:14,610
- What did I do?\N- Miguel! It's not his fault.

1346
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:17,190
- Fault? Hold up.\N- You blew another hole in the multiverse!

1347
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:20,740
- He doesn't know any better.\N- I do know what-- Not know what?

1348
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,320
But you did, Gwen.

1349
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:25,950
And you--\NI'm just gonna try to ignore you.

1350
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:28,000
- I just can't. I can't even.\N- I ain't even here.

1351
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:29,870
Or here.

1352
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:32,460
- What's happening?\N-  Hey, Miguel!

1353
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,090
Come on, go easy on the kid.

1354
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:38,550
- He had a terrible teacher.

1355
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:40,050
He had no chance.

1356
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:41,890
- Peter!\N- Oh, boy.

1357
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:44,430
Humbling-Reality Spider-Man has arrived.

1358
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:45,930
- Miles!\N- Dude!

1359
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:49,730
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel.\NHe just looks scary. He's got no bite.

1360
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:52,190
-  Peter.\N- You're growing up on me. You look great.

1361
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:55,900
- You look solid, you know. You look good.\N- Define "solid."

1362
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,940
What happened?\NYou bleeding from the armpits?

1363
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:00,610
- Peter, you--\N- Don't worry, we'll get you a new suit.

1364
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,360
Peter, you gotta tell them--

1365
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,870
- Wait. What is that?\N-  Mayday!

1366
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,330
- You have a baby!\N- I have a baby.

1367
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,410
This is crazy.

1368
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:09,870
Don't forget to keep\Nyour little day pass on, honey.

1369
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:12,670
Oh, you have one too.\NI didn't know they made those for adults.

1370
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:15,840
- Give me a second. Mayday!\N- The kid's an anarchist.

1371
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,420
I'm coming up to get you.\NHere I come. Don't move.

1372
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:23,590
I got you. I knew I was gonna regret\Nmaking her that web shooter.

1373
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,680
I shouldn't have done it.\NThat's an actual mistake.

1374
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:28,640
- You wanna see pictures?\N- She's right there.

1375
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,060
- Look at this pic!\N- Oh, you've got them.

1376
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:32,520
- She's incredible.\N- Yup.

1377
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,360
This is her funny face.\NThat's her mad face.

1378
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,230
This one is the studious one.

1379
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:39,990
Watch out,\Nthe next one you're gonna crack up.

1380
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:43,030
Miguel's gonna die.\NMiguel, look at this one.

1381
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:45,120
I'm trying to hold\Na serious adult conversation.

1382
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,990
You're the only Spider-Man\Nwho isn't funny.

1383
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,540
- We're supposed to be funny.\N- The fate of the multiverse--

1384
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,330
You always lose me with that.

1385
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:55,580
You say, "The fate of the multiverse,"\Nand my brain dies.

1386
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:58,840
Do you guys smell that?\NMayday took a crap.

1387
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,380
- Yup. She's a Parker.\N-  Miles.

1388
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,170
That's what happens\Nwhen a Parker eats an avocado.

1389
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:04,300
- You disrupted a canon event.\N- Canon event?

1390
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,260
The kid wasn't thinking.\NThat's not how he works.

1391
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,390
That's insulting.

1392
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:11,100
Taking a crap on the establishment.\NI salute you.

1393
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,640
Wait, what are you upset about?\NI saved those people.

1394
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,270
And that's the problem.

1395
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:20,190
- LYLA, do the thing.\N- Huh? What thing?

1396
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:23,110
What do you mean, "What thing?"\NThe information-explainy thing.

1397
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,200
Okay.

1398
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:31,910
What's this?

1399
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:35,370
This is everything.

1400
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,800
Can you be more specific?

1401
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,130
Can you not talk for a second?

1402
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:46,300
Yeah, yeah, I--

1403
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,300
And this here?

1404
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,810
This is all of us.

1405
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,690
All of our lives woven together

1406
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:57,770
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.

1407
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:00,150
The Spider-Verse.

1408
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:01,280
Spider-Verse.

1409
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,900
That's stupid.

1410
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:07,410
It's called\Nthe Arachnohumanoid Polymultiverse.

1411
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,370
Which sounds stupid too, I guess.

1412
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,120
And these nodes where the lines converge?

1413
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,330
They are the canon.

1414
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:22,050
Chapters that are a part\Nof every Spider's story every time.

1415
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,050
Some good.

1416
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:26,800
Some bad.

1417
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:30,010
Some very bad.

1418
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:39,610
Just keep going.

1419
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:41,150
Uncle Aaron.

1420
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,990
This one, Event ASM-90.

1421
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:48,360
A police captain close to Spider-Man dies,

1422
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:52,700
saving a kid from falling rubble\Nduring a battle with an archnemesis.

1423
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,500
Captain Stacy.

1424
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:56,870
I'm so sorry.

1425
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,680
No.

1426
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,650
That happened to you?

1427
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:25,110
And me.

1428
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:30,660
Ey. What of it?

1429
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,660
That's how the story is supposed to go.

1430
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:39,040
Canon events are the connections\Nthat bind our lives together.

1431
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:42,330
But those connections can be broken.

1432
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:48,090
That's why anomalies are so dangerous.

1433
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,890
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.

1434
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,930
You weren't supposed to be there.

1435
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:56,470
And you weren't supposed to save him.

1436
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,940
- That's why Gwen tried to stop you.\N-  Miles!

1437
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,230
I thought you were trying to save me.

1438
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,400
I was. I...

1439
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:08,320
I was doing both.

1440
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:13,410
And now, Miles,\Nbecause you changed the story,

1441
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:16,160
Pavitr's dimension is unravelling.

1442
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:19,500
If we're lucky, we can stop it.

1443
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,790
We haven't always been lucky.

1444
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:25,040
That wasn't me. That was the Spot.

1445
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,800
It's what happens\Nwhen you break the canon.

1446
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:31,300
How do you know?

1447
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,390
Because I broke it once myself.

1448
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:38,850
I found a world where I had a family.

1449
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:40,310
Where I was happy.

1450
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,190
At least, a version of me was.

1451
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:47,440
And that version of myself was killed.

1452
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:53,990
So I replaced him.

1453
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:59,410
I thought it was harmless.

1454
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,960
But I was wrong.

1455
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:14,840
Daddy? Dad.

1456
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,100
Daddy, no!

1457
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,640
Isn't that right, Peter?

1458
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:24,520
Yeah.

1459
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:28,360
You break enough canon,\Nsave enough captains...

1460
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,700
and we could lose everything.

1461
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,920
My dad is about to be captain.

1462
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,430
No.

1463
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,890
I'm gonna take everything from you...

1464
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,230
- like you took everything from me.\N-  I'm coming!

1465
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,150
Spot does it.

1466
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:15,280
He kills him.

1467
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,040
When does it happen?

1468
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:29,630
- When does it happen?\N- In two days.

1469
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,050
When he's sworn in.

1470
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,170
That's what the model says.

1471
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,510
I'm sorry, Miles.

1472
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:39,760
Send me home.

1473
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:42,390
I can't do that. Not now.

1474
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:45,680
What am I supposed to do?\NJust let him die?

1475
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:51,400
What about your dad?

1476
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,070
He's a captain, right?

1477
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,240
Yeah.

1478
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,200
And that's it?

1479
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,780
You aren't gonna do anything about it?

1480
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:04,580
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?

1481
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:08,750
That have been okay if you knew\Nand you just let it play out?

1482
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,790
If not for Uncle Ben,

1483
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:14,550
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.

1484
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:18,010
And all the good we did, it...

1485
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:19,840
It wouldn't have been done.

1486
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:25,430
So we're just supposed to let people die

1487
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:28,850
because some algorithm says that\Nthat's supposed to happen?

1488
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:32,060
You realise how messed up\Nthat sounds, right?

1489
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,900
You have a choice\Nbetween saving one person

1490
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,820
and saving an entire world.

1491
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:37,950
Every world.

1492
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,410
I can do both. Spider-Man always--

1493
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:41,740
Not always.

1494
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:48,370
Miles, we all want to live the life\Nwe wish we had.

1495
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,500
Believe me, I have tried.

1496
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:55,550
And the harder I tried,\Nthe more damage I did.

1497
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:58,880
You can't have it all, kid.

1498
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:05,510
Being Spider-Man is a sacrifice.

1499
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,350
That's the job.

1500
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:09,140
That's what you signed up for.

1501
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,270
Miles.

1502
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:14,940
Peni?

1503
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:17,110
What is this?

1504
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,740
Is this is an intervention or something?

1505
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:22,740
We know it's hard.

1506
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,450
But it's the truth, Miles.

1507
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:29,750
Is that why you're here?\NTo let me down easy?

1508
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,290
It worked last time,\Nwhy not run it back, huh?

1509
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:36,380
- Hey, hold on. Hold on.\N- You were right, Gwen.

1510
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,800
- You should've never come to see me.\N- Kid, look at--

1511
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,220
Stop calling me that.

1512
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:42,590
- There we go.\N- Hobie, not helping.

1513
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:45,050
- Good.\N- Miles, please understand.

1514
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:47,640
You can't ask me not to save my father.

1515
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:48,720
I'm not asking.

1516
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,190
Just give him a second, please.

1517
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,270
- This is a great look.\N- Don't! Stop it!

1518
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:57,190
If we let him leave, he'll only do\Nmore damage. We both know that.

1519
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:59,400
Little man. Peter Pan. Palms.

1520
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,700
Just need to hold you a few days.\NSorry it had to end like this, kid.

1521
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:06,030
I said not to call me that!

1522
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:18,880
- Miles!

1523
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:20,970
All right.

1524
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,840
I'm sorry for doing this.\NThis is bad parenting.

1525
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:26,680
Just for the record, I quit.

1526
01:33:29,930 --> 01:33:31,350
-  Huh?\N-  Uh...

1527
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:32,600
All stations,

1528
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,940
drop what you're doing\Nand stop Spider-Man.

1529
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,360
- You?\N- You?

1530
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,860
- Me?\N- Me?

1531
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:42,900
Miles! Miles Morales!\NHe's entering Sector 4!

1532
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,490
- Is that him?\N- Do I, uh, have web on my face?

1533
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:50,410
What's the deal?

1534
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:52,370
Miles! He's right there. He's right in--

1535
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:55,080
- Turn around!\N- I don't see anything, boss.

1536
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,730
Can this day get any damn weirder?

1537
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:19,940
Wow! I guess it can.

1538
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,280
- Whoa!\N- Sorry!

1539
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,250
And then I looked at my uncle, and...

1540
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:37,420
Uh, let me guess. He died?

1541
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,430
Whoa!

1542
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,600
On the count of three, draw.

1543
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,680
One-- You didn't wait for three!

1544
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,100
Hey, Miguel!

1545
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:57,230
Can you take a photo of this?\NIt's her first chase.

1546
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:02,940
Boo.

1547
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:07,780
-  Miles?\N-  Hi.

1548
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:10,280
- I'm a huge fan of your work.\N- Thanks.

1549
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,080
Do you think Spider-People too often use\Ncomedy as a crutch?

1550
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,830
- Uh...\N- Get it? "Crutch"?

1551
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,830
- I can do anything he can.

1552
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:19,710
Oh, dang, I pulled something.

1553
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:35,100
Meow!

1554
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:47,150
There's nowhere to run.

1555
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:57,790
My bad, everybody.\NThere was somewhere to run.

1556
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:09,800
-  Stop running!\N- Then stop chasing me!

1557
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,840
You're so frustrating.

1558
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,720
I know he's your friend,\Nbut it's the only way.

1559
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,270
- But my gut says--\N- Then use your head.

1560
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,960
I've got you trapped\Nin my well-defined musculature.

1561
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,460
So don't even--

1562
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:02,690
Miles.

1563
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:05,520
- No, no. Let me go.\N- It is crazy to run.

1564
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,280
Running is the least crazy thing going on.

1565
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,650
- Look, I feel bad.\N- Good!

1566
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:13,660
But this is just how stuff works.\NYou're not gonna win here.

1567
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:16,370
Just wait, don't move.\NStop moving so fast.

1568
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:17,450
No!

1569
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:19,870
- Do you wanna hold my baby?\N- What?

1570
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:22,080
Would you just give the baby one squeeze\Nand then we'll talk?

1571
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,750
I think it's gonna change our vibe.\NIt's very rejuvenating.

1572
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:26,210
I'm plenty juvenated.

1573
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:29,800
You'll get more so when you go\Nchest-to-chest with this magical child.

1574
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,220
You don't get to have\Na heartfelt conversation with me.

1575
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:34,430
Just hold the baby,\Nwe'll see what happens!

1576
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:38,720
You're the reason I had her, okay?

1577
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:43,640
I thought that if I did\Na decent job raising her,

1578
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:47,400
then there was a chance\Nshe was gonna turn out like you.

1579
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,990
And that got me excited\Nbecause you are a wonderful person.

1580
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:53,820
- And I like being around you.

1581
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:57,070
Then why didn't you come see me?

1582
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:58,700
Bec--

1583
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:01,160
I couldn't.

1584
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,370
I wanted to be with you guys so badly.

1585
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:09,000
But this thing\Nisn't what I thought it was.

1586
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,760
Look, bad things are gonna happen.

1587
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:15,300
It makes us who we are.

1588
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:19,220
But good things happen too, you know?

1589
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:21,810
Like you happened.

1590
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,140
And she happened.

1591
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,810
Hey, I don't...

1592
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:31,780
And you are so bad at holding a baby.

1593
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:34,400
-  We got your location, Peter.\N- Wait, wait. No, no!

1594
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,570
You do not have my location. Over.

1595
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:37,660
Send everyone.

1596
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,540
No, no, no, Miles, I didn't know.\NI promise you.

1597
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,410
Please, man, let's talk about this.

1598
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:45,330
We did.

1599
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:48,960
Good talk.

1600
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:54,260
Get him!

1601
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:08,350
Miles!

1602
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:11,270
- Where does he think he's going?\N-  Don't think he planned this out.

1603
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:13,690
If I hadn't said it before, by the way,

1604
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:15,610
you're a terrible mentor.

1605
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:27,750
He did just beat you,\Nso I'm not a terrible mentor.

1606
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:30,380
You're both equally terrible.\NDoes that settle it?

1607
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:34,170
Stop pretending\Nyou know where you're going!

1608
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:37,550
Oh, I have a plan.\NI just haven't told you yet.

1609
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,480
-  Departing for the moon.\N- That's not good.

1610
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:15,500
What are those, claws?

1611
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:18,130
Dude, are you sure you're even Spider-Man?

1612
01:40:18,130 --> 01:40:19,630
Are you?

1613
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:21,930
Who do you think you are? Really?

1614
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:27,810
My name is Miles Morales.

1615
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:36,360
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

1616
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,820
And I'm pretty sure\Nyou know the rest, jerk!

1617
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,170
Hey. What's up, man?

1618
01:40:53,210 --> 01:40:55,340
You don't get it. You're an anomaly.

1619
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:57,670
Not if you let me go home.

1620
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,220
Snitch!

1621
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,510
Everywhere you go, you're an anomaly.

1622
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,150
You're the original anomaly.

1623
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:21,950
Miguel!

1624
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:26,740
The spider that gave you\Nyour powers wasn't from your dimension.

1625
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:30,330
It was never supposed to bite you.

1626
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,040
Miguel, don't!

1627
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:34,750
There's a world out there\Nwith no Spider-Man to protect them

1628
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:36,420
- because it bit you instead.\N- No.

1629
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:38,460
You're not supposed to be Spider-Man.

1630
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,970
No! You're lying. I'm Spider-Man!

1631
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:42,510
You're a mistake!

1632
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:48,100
If you hadn't been bit,\Nyour Peter Parker would have lived.

1633
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:50,810
Instead, he died saving you.

1634
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:54,230
He would've stopped the collider\Nbefore it ever went off.

1635
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:55,560
Spot wouldn't exist.

1636
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,900
- And none of this would've happened.\N- Peter.

1637
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:03,400
And all this time, I have been\Nthe only one holding it all together.

1638
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,240
-  Miguel, go easy on him!\N- You don't belong here.

1639
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:08,490
You never did.

1640
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:10,040
Let me go.

1641
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,790
- Miguel, that's enough.\N- This isn't what we talked about.

1642
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,500
You talked about this?

1643
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,090
You knew?

1644
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,550
You all knew?

1645
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,380
I didn't know...

1646
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:26,720
how to tell you.

1647
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,600
That's why you never came to see me.

1648
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:37,310
- Miles, it's for your own good.\N- Who decides that?

1649
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,610
I'm not a kid, Gwen.

1650
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:41,980
That's exactly what you are.

1651
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:46,700
You're just a kid\Nwho has no idea what he's doing!

1652
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:53,580
Yeah, well,

1653
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:56,920
I did lure hundreds of Spider-People\Naway from your little clubhouse.

1654
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:57,830
What?

1655
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:05,340
I guess he did plan this out.

1656
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:09,600
And I'm about to do this.

1657
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:18,770
Everyone keeps telling me\Nhow my story is supposed to go.

1658
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:20,810
Nah.

1659
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:22,320
I'm gonna do my own thing.

1660
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,210
Goodbye, Gwen.

1661
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,930
Miles!

1662
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:53,560
I taught him how to do that,

1663
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:56,850
so I gotta be a pretty good mentor\Nto pull that off.

1664
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:10,410
Nope. No. Uh-uh.

1665
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:13,280
That's kind of cute. Oh, no. Mm-mm.

1666
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,410
Been there. Done that.

1667
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,250
- Huh?

1668
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,310
Initialising Go Home Machine.

1669
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:55,950
Dimensional signature identified.

1670
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:06,590
Come on.

1671
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:08,210
No. No.

1672
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:10,340
- Oh, no.\N- No.

1673
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:17,560
What's happening?

1674
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,390
The machine activated on its own.

1675
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:21,350
- How is that possible?\N- It isn't.

1676
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:23,520
It's not possible\Nfor the accelerator protocol

1677
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,480
to engage without entering a sequence key.

1678
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:28,190
- Okay. Which...?\N- Which it's doing right now.

1679
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,240
- How about this?\N- No.

1680
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,110
- How about now?\N- You're getting in the way.

1681
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,510
Stop him! Now!

1682
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:53,970
What does it look like I'm trying to do?

1683
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,390
Do something.

1684
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:05,020
Now!

1685
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:08,570
Miguel.

1686
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:09,780
Miguel, stop!

1687
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:38,640
No!

1688
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:55,280
Okay. Enough.\NIt's not the console's fault.

1689
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,240
All he had to do was listen!

1690
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:00,490
- Why didn't he listen?\N- Maybe you weren't hard enough.

1691
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:02,910
- Gwen, don't do it.\N-  You let him go.

1692
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:04,410
- Me?\N- You didn't catch him, Gwen.

1693
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:07,750
- Okay, let's all just take a breath.\N- Peter, you wanna back me up?

1694
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:12,250
Well, okay, Miguel, as a father\Nof a daughter and the son of a mother--

1695
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,550
- Yeah, actually, stop talking.\N- Okay, duly noted.

1696
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:16,260
Let me just talk to him.

1697
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:18,510
We tried that.

1698
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:20,680
- He's my friend.\N- Yeah. And that's the problem.

1699
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:23,810
Do you know for certain\Nwhat happens if he breaks the canon?

1700
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:29,190
Do you wanna find out?\NI told you she was a liability.

1701
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:31,610
You're wrong.

1702
01:47:31,610 --> 01:47:33,610
Jess, tell him he's wrong.

1703
01:47:35,530 --> 01:47:36,650
He's not.

1704
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:38,490
Are you serious right now?

1705
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:42,870
I told you.\NYou let him get away, I can't help you.

1706
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:44,540
I'm not coming.

1707
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:45,790
You're right.

1708
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:46,790
What...?

1709
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:49,580
What the hell?

1710
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:01,220
Go home, Gwen.

1711
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,940
We are supposed to be the good guys.

1712
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:26,290
We are.

1713
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:30,790
We are.

1714
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,670
Jess, Ben. Come with me.

1715
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:35,750
Hell, yeah.

1716
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:37,300
And somebody catch Spot.

1717
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:40,300
Yeah. Sorry.\NI gotta get her down for her nap.

1718
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:43,300
Not you. I've had the right amount of you.

1719
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:32,190
Hey, hon.

1720
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:37,020
How was work?

1721
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:39,360
I don't know.

1722
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,860
Peter? Did you bring our baby\Nto another fight?

1723
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:45,240
Did I bring our ba--? No. No, no.

1724
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:48,330
'Cause you asked me not to.\NSo I didn't. I wouldn't.

1725
01:49:48,990 --> 01:49:51,710
Access denied. Access denied.

1726
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:21,940
You think I'll be any good at this?

1727
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,740
You're asking that now?

1728
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:29,200
There's no playbook\Nfor raising someone like her...

1729
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:33,120
or being someone like you.

1730
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:40,090
You just gotta make\Nthe right adjustments at half-time.

1731
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:47,800
- That's a sports metaphor, by the way.\N- I understand.

1732
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:50,560
Sorry. You were just such a nerd\Nin high school. I figured--

1733
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,180
But I have watched sports.

1734
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:55,310
- Okay, champ.\N- Unbelievable.

1735
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:24,670
Wanna go easy on the penguin?

1736
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,130
Would you just...?

1737
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:29,390
You gonna even look at me?

1738
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,850
What? What is that?

1739
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:37,390
I'm looking at you. Like you asked.

1740
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:41,150
You look skinny.

1741
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:43,730
Where have you been?

1742
01:51:43,730 --> 01:51:47,110
Just been, uh,\Nout murdering all my friends.

1743
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:50,780
Oh, that's funny, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

1744
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,750
-  Where are you going?\N- I don't know.

1745
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,840
You're a good cop, Dad.

1746
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:08,680
You put on that badge\Nbecause you know if you don't,

1747
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,760
someone who shouldn't will.

1748
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,640
But you have to understand,

1749
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:17,230
this mask is my badge.

1750
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:21,110
And I'm trying to be good too.

1751
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,020
I was trying so hard

1752
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:26,440
to wear this thing\Nthe way you would want...

1753
01:52:27,030 --> 01:52:28,530
and I didn't.

1754
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,360
I didn't.

1755
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:34,030
I can do all these things, but I can't\Nhelp the people I love the most.

1756
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:36,660
And they can only know half of who I am.

1757
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:40,210
So I'm completely on my own.

1758
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:43,710
And now I don't even know\Nwhat the right thing is anymore.

1759
01:52:43,710 --> 01:52:46,760
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\NBut I know...

1760
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,470
I can't lose one more friend.

1761
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:58,140
Gwen, I always taught you\Nto do it by the book.

1762
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,770
And how did that work out?

1763
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:02,730
- I took an oath.\N- Then arrest me, Dad.

1764
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:06,820
- Get it over with.\N- I... I can't.

1765
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:08,110
Why not?

1766
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:10,240
Because I quit.

1767
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:12,410
When?

1768
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,660
About halfway through your big speech.

1769
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:17,330
You're...

1770
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:20,250
Wait a minute,\Nyou're not gonna be captain?

1771
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:22,580
That means...

1772
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:26,550
My job, being captain,

1773
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:30,930
this whole thing doesn't matter anymore.

1774
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:37,520
You're the best thing I've ever done.

1775
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:55,780
- It was a good speech, huh?\N- No wonder you got an A in English.

1776
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:57,790
B. I got a B-plus.

1777
01:53:57,790 --> 01:53:59,200
Missed a few classes.

1778
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,210
I don't know what it is you gotta do...

1779
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,550
but I think\Nthat this thing is supposed to help.

1780
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:12,090
The guy who left it was\Na real piece of work.

1781
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:37,990
I'll be right back.

1782
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:41,120
Promise.

1783
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:51,550
Parenting stuff is...

1784
01:54:53,130 --> 01:54:54,430
a big-ass mystery.

1785
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:02,270
You're a mistake!

1786
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:05,940
If you hadn't been bit,\Nyour Peter Parker would have lived.

1787
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,560
And none of this would've happened.

1788
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,230
Miles, the hardest thing about this job

1789
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:13,570
is you can't always save everybody.

1790
01:55:13,570 --> 01:55:17,280
I'll make you pay\Nfor everything you took away from me.

1791
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,490
You have a choice\Nbetween saving one person

1792
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:21,330
and saving an entire world.

1793
01:55:21,330 --> 01:55:23,500
I can do both. Spider-Man always--

1794
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,540
Not always.

1795
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:27,790
Whatever you're gonna do out there,\Ndon't get lost.

1796
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:31,340
-  Bad things are gonna happen.\N-  I didn't know how to tell you.

1797
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:33,340
You were never supposed\Nto be Spider-Man.

1798
01:55:36,010 --> 01:55:37,010
Keep going.

1799
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,650
Did you check your locations?

1800
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:57,150
- Yes, Dad.\N- No sign of him.

1801
01:55:57,150 --> 01:56:01,280
LYLA, would you send everyone out?\NAnywhere. Anywhere he might be.

1802
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,540
Congrats, captain.

1803
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:05,250
"Captain"? You can't call me that\Nuntil I'm sworn in.

1804
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:07,710
We're all proud of you. See you, jefe.

1805
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:36,740
Perfect pose.

1806
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:41,570
Possible disturbance in the alley.\NBetter go check it out.

1807
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:46,250
Now I'm here in the alley.\NThere's something unusual happening.

1808
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:48,410
Looking at the walls. Those are normal.

1809
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:51,170
But there's something in front of me.

1810
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:13,150
I made it.

1811
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:15,020
I'm home.

1812
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:28,120
Is now a bad time?

1813
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:30,250
- Am I too late?\N- What'd you do to your hair?

1814
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:32,250
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

1815
01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:34,130
I'm okay.

1816
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,010
You were right.\NYou were right about everything.

1817
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:40,010
Of course I'm right. I'm always right.

1818
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:43,890
- What am I right about?\N- I saw all these amazing places

1819
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,680
and met all these amazing people, but...

1820
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:51,770
But they didn't want me.

1821
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:54,810
I kept thinking about what you said.

1822
01:57:56,070 --> 01:57:57,860
And I let them have it, Mom.

1823
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,610
I beat them all.

1824
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:06,410
I know how strong I am now.

1825
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:09,750
I'm strong because of you.

1826
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:11,540
And Dad.

1827
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,080
And us.

1828
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:17,750
Mom.

1829
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:21,260
There's something coming for us.

1830
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:23,430
Something...

1831
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:25,050
Something terrible.

1832
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:27,890
Miles, you're talking crazy.\NWhat's going on?

1833
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:31,230
His name is Spot. He's my nemesis.

1834
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:34,100
And I'm gonna stop him.

1835
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:41,940
I know you know I've been lying to you.

1836
01:58:42,950 --> 01:58:45,240
It's because I thought if you knew...

1837
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:48,450
you wouldn't love me the same.

1838
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,960
And then I went out there and...

1839
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:55,170
And now...

1840
01:58:57,170 --> 01:58:58,790
I'm not afraid of anything.

1841
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:03,220
What do you wanna tell me?

1842
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:05,010
Promise nothing's gonna change.

1843
01:59:05,010 --> 01:59:07,600
- Papá, I will always love you.\N- You gotta promise.

1844
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:10,510
Always. I don't care what you say.

1845
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:12,730
Do ¿me entiendes?

1846
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:20,480
Mom.

1847
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:23,570
I'm...

1848
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:26,740
I'm Spider-Man.

1849
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,170
Who's Spider-Man?

1850
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:44,880
The superhero? He got bit by a spider?

1851
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:48,050
Gave him spider powers?

1852
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:51,640
He's me?

1853
01:59:56,730 --> 02:00:00,110
Is this where you dress up\Nlike your favourite character for...?

1854
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:02,150
What's it called? Comics-Con?

1855
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:03,650
I don't know what that is.

1856
02:00:03,650 --> 02:00:07,280
You really had me going there. Spider-Man.

1857
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,580
Why don't you have eight arms?

1858
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:18,870
- Um...\N- Do you push silk out of your culito?

1859
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:21,670
- I had a nightmare about that, but no.\N- Are you sure you woke up?

1860
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:43,480
Mom, stop playing around. This is serious.

1861
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:45,190
Dad worked with Spider-Man.

1862
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:48,700
He didn't realise Spider-Man was me\Nat the time, but...

1863
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:51,700
- I wish Dad was here to explain.\N- Miles, please.

1864
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:59,420
I got you to take care of,\NI got me to take care of, so help me out.

1865
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:01,500
Mom, hold on, hold on. I need to talk--

1866
02:01:07,590 --> 02:01:08,420
Oh, no.

1867
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:14,760
He's in the wrong universe.

1868
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:19,100
The spider that gave you\Nyour powers wasn't from your dimension.

1869
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:22,770
- Forty-two.\N-  Its home dimension.

1870
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:27,900
Dimensional signature identified.

1871
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:30,150
 That machine...

1872
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:34,530
didn't send me home.

1873
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:50,090
Uncle Aaron?

1874
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:52,260
Hey.

1875
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:04,730
You okay?

1876
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:13,240
I missed you so much.

1877
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:15,700
Okay. All right, then.

1878
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:18,660
- Whoa, you took your braids out?\N- Uh...

1879
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:20,000
- On purpose?\N- Yeah.

1880
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,830
Yeah, I'm still getting used to it?

1881
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:28,250
They gave me more hours at the hospital,\Nso next month I swear I'll pay you back.

1882
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:29,840
Stop. Come on. We family.

1883
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:31,720
Thanks.

1884
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:36,600
-  Hey, honey, how you doing?\N- Hey. How'd it go with Miles?

1885
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:39,640
- You know how you grounded him?\N- Mm-hm.

1886
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:42,230
- I ungrounded him.\N- You what?

1887
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:44,900
A little. I mean, how much trouble\Ncould he get into, right?

1888
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:47,360
-  A lot of trouble!\N-  I don't wanna think about it.

1889
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,940
Oh, Miles, I have to work\Nan overnight tonight.

1890
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:54,410
- Here's the grocery list.\N- I'll make sure he gets these done.

1891
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:57,370
All right, we gotta roll.

1892
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:04,870
Security switches out at 6.\NThat's the window, right?

1893
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:06,830
Right. Yeah.

1894
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:12,170
I'm following you in what you are saying.

1895
02:03:16,050 --> 02:03:16,890
You all right?

1896
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:19,310
I have a cold.

1897
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:22,220
Come on, man.

1898
02:03:23,230 --> 02:03:24,890
Hey, you sure you got the plan?

1899
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:28,560
Yeah, but maybe we should\Ngo over it one more time,

1900
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,520
just to make sure there's no...

1901
02:03:31,610 --> 02:03:32,610
problems.

1902
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:42,160
There's no Spider-Man here.

1903
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:16,200
I'm sorry, baby,\Nbut you did unilaterally unground him.

1904
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:17,110
Jeff...

1905
02:04:17,110 --> 02:04:20,780
I just worry about him getting\Nmixed up with the wrong people, okay?

1906
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:22,620
This is probably that girl.

1907
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:24,790
What is he even thinking, being with her?

1908
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:26,460
I have some ideas.

1909
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:30,330
- Baby, you're really not helping.\N- You saw the way he lit up around her.

1910
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:33,880
I just hope she doesn't get him hurt.

1911
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:38,720
I mean, am I responsible for this?

1912
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:40,890
- No, no.\N- Maybe it's all my fault.

1913
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:43,760
Come on, papá, you're a great dad.\NThis is hard.

1914
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:45,060
This is hard.

1915
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:50,190
It's like we got a whole new kid\Nwho just wants to grow up so fast.

1916
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:54,020
And maybe we gotta grow up too.

1917
02:04:55,780 --> 02:04:56,780
A little bit.

1918
02:04:56,780 --> 02:04:59,910
Maybe we just gotta let him\Nspread his wings, man.

1919
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:01,620
"Man"?

1920
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:03,200
It's not your fault.

1921
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:07,330
It's mine.

1922
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:10,370
Oh, come on.\NWhat the heck are you doing here?

1923
02:05:10,370 --> 02:05:12,630
Oh, uh, his window was open so I came in.

1924
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:15,000
Because that's normal to do.

1925
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,800
I wanna talk to your parents.

1926
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,880
Right. My, uh, dad's kind of hard\Nto get on the horn.

1927
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,390
Oh, really? What does he do? Deal drugs?

1928
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:23,220
He's a cop.

1929
02:05:25,430 --> 02:05:26,930
Statement withdrawn.

1930
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:28,430
I'm gonna call the station.

1931
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:31,770
I don't think he's there.\NOr anywhere around here.

1932
02:05:31,770 --> 02:05:34,980
- That's his jacket, emo. Where's Miles?\N- I don't know.

1933
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:37,110
You don't know?\NWhat do you mean, you don't know?

1934
02:05:37,110 --> 02:05:38,650
Yeah, um, I'll leave.

1935
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:41,110
Where do you think you're going,\Nyoung lady?

1936
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:42,870
I'm going to find him.

1937
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:45,780
I don't know where, exactly.

1938
02:05:47,410 --> 02:05:48,950
But I know where to start.

1939
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:52,580
One thing I learned from Miles:

1940
02:05:54,210 --> 02:05:55,590
It's all possible.

1941
02:05:58,260 --> 02:06:01,380
He loves you more\Nthan you could ever imagine.

1942
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:06,680
I've seen it.

1943
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:13,560
If you do find him...

1944
02:06:15,810 --> 02:06:17,440
tell him five months.

1945
02:06:20,070 --> 02:06:21,570
And tell him we love him.

1946
02:06:23,530 --> 02:06:24,370
You got it.

1947
02:06:58,610 --> 02:07:01,190
Uncle Aaron?

1948
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:07,410
Wait, wait.

1949
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:09,910
Listen to me. Okay, look.

1950
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:16,920
You don't understand. I'm not from here.

1951
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:20,250
Listen, okay?\NThis machine sent me here by mistake.

1952
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:22,800
Wait, wait, wait. Please. Please.

1953
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,470
Uncle Aaron, wait, wait, wait.\NUncle Aaron!

1954
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:44,530
Please. Uncle Aaron?

1955
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:47,240
Just hear me out.

1956
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:53,580
I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.

1957
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:57,830
It wasn't supposed to bite me.\NIt was supposed to bite someone else.

1958
02:07:57,830 --> 02:07:59,080
Someone from here.

1959
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:02,250
I don't belong here. I need to go home.

1960
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:03,670
Okay?

1961
02:08:06,010 --> 02:08:08,680
I have an Uncle Aaron too. I had one.

1962
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:11,720
- He was a bad guy called the Prowler.

1963
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,520
He looked out for me.

1964
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:17,440
He did a lot of bad things, but...

1965
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:19,900
I knew he wanted to be good.

1966
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:22,780
He just didn't know he had a choice,\Nbut you do.

1967
02:08:23,730 --> 02:08:24,820
You can be a good guy.

1968
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:28,280
"A good guy"?

1969
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:32,160
Please. Trust me.\NI know you don't wanna be the Prowler.

1970
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:45,760
I'm not.

1971
02:08:59,190 --> 02:09:02,610
Mayor Manfredi\Nhas extended New York's mandatory curfew

1972
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:06,990
as the so-called Sinister Six cartels\Nbattle for control on the streets.

1973
02:09:06,990 --> 02:09:08,820
Is nobody gonna try and stop them?

1974
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,210
Your dad is still alive?

1975
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:27,920
What?

1976
02:09:28,590 --> 02:09:29,630
Your father.

1977
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:32,140
You said he's still alive.

1978
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:34,140
Yeah.

1979
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:40,560
Who are you?

1980
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:51,030
I'm Miles Morales.

1981
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:54,530
But you...

1982
02:09:55,410 --> 02:09:57,080
You can call me the Prowler.

1983
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:00,790
If I don't get home...

1984
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:04,130
our dad is gonna die.

1985
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:05,210
Your dad.

1986
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:08,710
Please.

1987
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,220
You have to let me go.

1988
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:19,350
Why would I do that?

1989
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:20,540
Don't tell Mom.

1990
02:11:27,670 --> 02:11:29,550
I never found the right band to join.

1991
02:11:31,630 --> 02:11:33,550
So I started my own.

1992
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:38,800
With a few old friends.

1993
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:02,120
You want in?
